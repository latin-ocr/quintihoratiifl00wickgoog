carried to tbe extent oi producing revolting or marvellous soenes on the
stage.

189-192. Five acts, no more end no less. A ‘dens ex machina’ only when the
occasion really requires it. Three characters only on the stage nt once.

¹93·20¹= On the other hand the Chorus must be treated cs an integral part oi the
drama. Its business is to help on the action, and specinlly to take the moral
and religious side in it.

aon-219. The lyrioel part oi the drame was simplet in old days As audienoes
have become more mixed the music became more elaborate, the diction more
stilted, the tone more oracular.

οπο-239. (ln the same way) the desire to interest n miscellaneous andience led
to adding the Satyric drama to tragedy. But moderetion and tect are
necessary. Tragic characters must not be lowered iu the following Satyric
drama. Neither need they rent. Trugedy has its proper dignlty; so hes
the Satyric drame itsels. It is not tmgedy, but neither is it comedy.

²40·²43· Do not look for an original story, only sor ireshness oi treatment.

²44·² 50. The cboms oi satyrs must keep irom low und coarse language: think
oi the better not ol the worse part oi your audience.

251-269. Metre. Avoid the great fault oi the older Roman tmgedians, hesvy

1 am trying to teach others to write it. as a whetstone makes knives cut
though it cannot cut itseli.

poetry that lives
