⁴ Dr. Verrass, in his ‘Studies in Horace' has an ingenious chapter in which he argues that
the Lamia of this Epistle and the two (ides is none other than the ‘vilicus' himself, the
name being here substituted for the personui pronoun, as ‘Horatius' for ‘ego' in the pre·
oeding line. lt follows that ¹ moratur' and ‘istuc fert' must mean ‘hinders me from' and ‘drives
me to' the discussion to follow. 'l'his is in itself an objection to the view. The words are
singularly unlike Horace's usual ironical way of entering upon a hilosophical lecture. There
is also the same difficulty which weighs against the reading ‘Pulliae' in Od. 3. ⁴· ro. the un·
likelihood of such a personal detail in the poet's life having escaped notice in early times. lt
also makes the ‘vilicus' a much more important person in the Epistle than on our theory he is.
