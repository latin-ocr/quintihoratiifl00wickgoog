LIB. 11. EPIST. a.

Obturem patulas impune legentibus aures. ’

Ridentur mala qui componunt carmina; verum

Gaudent scribentes et se venerantur, et ultro,

Si taceas, laudant quicquid scripsere beati.

At qui legitimum cupiet fecisse poema,

Cum tabulis animum censoris sumet honesti3 110
Audebit, quaecunque parurn splendoris habebunt

Et sine pondere erunt et honore indigna feruntur,

Verba movere loco, quamvis invita recedant

Et versentur adhuct intra penetralia Vestae.
