402 HORATII ARS POETICA.

Interpres, nec desilies imitator in arctum

Unde pedem proferre pudor vetet aut operis lex. 1³5
Nec sic incipies ut scriptor cyclicus olim:

‘Fortunam Priami cantabo et nobile bellum!

Quid dignum tauto ieret hic promissor hiatu?

Parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus.

‘Dic mihi, Musa, virum captae post tempora Troiae

Qui mores hominum multorum vidit et urbes?

Non fumum ex fulgore, sed ex fumo dare lucem

Cogitat, ut speciosa dehinc miracula promat,

Antiphaten Scyllamque et cum Cyclope Charybdin. ¹45
