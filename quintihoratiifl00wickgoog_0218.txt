LIB. 11. sar. 8. 199

Orelli, who is in accord with most authorities, wanges the ‘triclinium' thus:

imus locus
siveconsularis

uramus vinnius Q

medius lectus

medius sumtus

curramus Nomentanus

&a
medius Nasidienus ζ Viscus medius

fmus Porcius Fundanius

Maecenas occupied the place of honour. The only departure from usual
practice is that noticed by Horace in v. 23, viz. that Nasidienus put Nomentanus
in his own place next to the chief guest as more able thau himself to do the
honours of the table.
