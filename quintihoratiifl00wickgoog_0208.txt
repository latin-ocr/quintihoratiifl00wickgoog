LIB. ΙΙ. SAT. 7. 189

111-115. ‘Nay, yon are a runaway, for you are always trying to escape yoorself
and give the slip to care; but you are caught again, as a slave might be.'
116-118. This last sally is supposed to exhaust Horace’s patience, and after one
more thrust Davus is driven away by the threat that he shall be sent to the

Sabine farm.

It is a companion Satire to the third of this Book. The substautial part cf both
is in the playful use of a Stoic paradox as a text for a discourse cu the follies of
meu. ln both Horace turns the laugh against himself, Damasippus there, Davus
here, eharging him with his own faultsand especially with tlte two, laziness (Sat. 3)
and changeableness (Sat. 7), to which he professes to plead guilty iu Epp. t. 8. to-
12. In the third Satire the thesis taken is the one dealt with in Cicerc’s Paradox, 4
ὅτι aristippum μαίνεται, in this one Cicero’s Paradox, 5 ὅτι μόνος d σοφὸς ἐλεύθερος
real πᾶς ἄφρων δοῦλος. There are sigusia both that Horace was familiar with
Cicero’s expositione of the text. The setting in each case is dramatic‚ the para-
dox being pressed on Horace in Sat. 3 hythe bankrupt virtuoso, who has himself
been saved from suicide by discovering that he was no more mad than most men
-in this Satire being put into the concrete form of a slave’s claim, urged with the
freedom of a licensed moment, to be as good as his master. ln neither Satire is
the dramatic purpose kept perfectly; when the Stoic teaching is reached the style
becomes declamatory and imitativa of the lecturer, and the particular occasion is
for the moment torgotten.

The Blaud. MSS. had this Satire (as have some good extant MSS.) written
contiuuously with the preceding oue-evidentlyamistake3 but it bears witness to a
true instinct of the close relation between this Satire and its predecessore. Bentley
explains ‘iamdudum ausculto' iu v. r ol Davus having heard Horace declaim Sat. 6,
and feeling stirred to answer it. This is probably put too narrowly ; but the position
of the Satire iu relation to Sat. 6, when compared with that of Sat. 3 to Sat a, and
its position in relation tc the Book in view of its manifest reference to both the
directly didactic Satires (cp. vv. aa, ²3 with Sat. a. a. 89-93, as well as v. 28 with
Sat. 6) make it clear that one purpose is to lighten with his habitual irony any
tone of assumption that might be felt in the preceding Satires. ‘Who arn 1
to lecture others? They may very well return it in kind.'

tt should be noticed that it ,r's irony, though the irony be a vell of real modesty.
Not to speak of the graver charges which he seems to countenunce against himself,
his love for the country which he appears here, for fcar of having spoken too en·
thusiastically about it iu Sat. 6, to undervalue as a mere phase of feeling, was deep
and tme; see Epp. 1. ro. a and 14. He contrasts his own constaucy iu respect of
’ it with his bailiif's changeableness, Epp. t. 14. 14-26.
