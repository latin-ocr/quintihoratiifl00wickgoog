' vv. 225, 386). We can distinguish the different relation which the

three persons addressed hold towards the Epistle. The father ligures
ratheras the critic on whom the young writer may lean, and who will
enlorce Horace's teaching, than as a poet or learner himself at the
presenttime. The younger son is onlyineluded as making upthe literary
family. But as the poem goes on it becomes clear that the elder son
is the person lor whom the advice is intended, ‘O maior iuvenum,
quamvis et voce patema Fingens ad rectum et per te sapis,' etc., and
that he is imagined as having not only literary ambitions, but definite
poetical schemes.

Horace is putting on paper an old poet's advice to a young
aspirant. He does not discourage him, but he would enlist him, il
he is to bea poet, as a recruit in the severe and classical school. In
an age ol scribblers he must give time to accumulate materials, time
to understand his business; he must subject his work to honest and
rigorous criticism; he must be slow to give it to the world. , .

We may distinguish perhaps three parts of the poem: but they ·
pass naturally into one another, and a single thread binds them
together in the repeated doctrine, that poetry is an art and asan
art has mles, and supposes previous instruction and patient eliort.

Vv. 1-118 deal with general principles of poetry, unity os concep
tion, choice ol words, style of diction.

Vv. 119-284. When srom diction he passes to characters it soon
becomes evident that, for some reason unexplained‚ he has dramatic
poetry specially in view; and various points are touched in relation
to it, some larger, some smaller; but the leading principle through·
out is that the best Greek practice is to be the rule.

Vv. 28 5-end. So we go back to what is applicable to all kinds ol
poetry; the comparison of the Greek and Roman temperament, the
two aims ol poetry, the necessity os excellence, the poet's high call·
ing, the need ol training the solly os wilfulness.

Something ol the same disproportion in the space given to the
drama has been noticed in the Ep. ad Augustum. There it has been
probably explained by the lact that dramatic writing had become
popular again in the Augustan period. But the phenomenon is
more marked ln the Ars Poetica. It not only has more than its
share: it is the only kind ol poetry specifically dealt with, and we
find upon it detailed and practical rules. It is difficult not to think
that the explanation lies in the line which the young Piso’s literary
ambition was taking. He was planning or writing a play. How
closely Horace is touching his plana it seems impossible to define.
