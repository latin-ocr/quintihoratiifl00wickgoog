306 HORATII EPISTULARUM

96-112. But through it all do notlose sight of the true ends of life. Think whether
al'ter all the peace of a private life is not the happiest thing. Think of me in

my Sabine valley with my books, my modest competence, and my contented

mind. ι

On the general subject of the Epistle aud its relation to Ep. 17 see the intro
duction to that Epistle. The subject of a dependent's behaviour is continued, bnt
in a different vein; this time in a letter which has, in part at least, close relations to
the circumstances of Lollius. It is not a needy rnau making np to a patron for a
dinner and for the benefit of his relations (Ep. 17. ari, but a man born in good
position. The Epistle speaks (vv. 60-64) of his father’s estate, and he is probably
the Lollius of Ep. a, aud theson of the Lollius who was consul in ac. ar (Ep.
ao. 28). He is thought of as entering the friendship not of some merely rich
patron, bnt of a ‘potens amicus,' a rnan high in the political world, with secreta of
importance which his protlgl must respect and keep (vv. 37, 38 and 68-70). The
Epistle, however, is not free from difficulties. The dangers against which Lollius
iswamed in vv. 21-36 and 72-75 seem ill suited to the kind of character pre-
sumed in the rest of the poem; and, taking the Epistle as a whole, and supposing
that Lollius had really attached himself to some one of high position in the Court
circle, it is not easy to believe that its immediate publication can have been agree·
able either to patron or protlgl. This last supposition, however, is not necessary.
The conditions of the case are satisfied if Lollius,a young literary friend of the
poet. was contemplating the acceptance of such an office as that which Augustus
himself offered to Horace, or that which Celsus holds in Ep. 8; and if Horace-
wrote to him, perhaps at his request, sketching the duties and dangers of a private
secretary iu a great house. Part of the lecture may have been evidently playful,
and the issue of the Epistle may have been that Lollius declined the office.

lt is to be noticed that any disrespect to Lollius is out of the question, supposing
him to be the person we imagine. lt seems also that the Epistle was written in
n. c. ao (see on v. 56 and introd. to the Epistlcs, p. aoy), and published therefore
within a few months.
