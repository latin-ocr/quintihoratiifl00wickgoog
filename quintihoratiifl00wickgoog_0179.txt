160 HORATII SATIRARUM

SATIRE 1V.

cartus, OR THE ART OF DlNlNG.

Hostes meets Catius‘hurrying home to arrange his notes oi a gastronomieal
lecture which he has just heard. When pressed to name the lecturer he makes
a mystery οι ιι, hut he gives the heads οι the lecture (1-10).

It compriaed hints ou choosing eggs(11—14). cabhage (15, 16), ou drassing
a iovi hastily so as tu be teuder (ry-20), on choosing mushrooms (ao, ιι), ou
the wholesomeness oi certain articles of diet (ar-29), the season and locality
oi varians shellfish (30-34), the importanee oi stndying sauces (ιι-39), subtle
points with respect to the condition and age of various animals. suh, aud birds
(40-46)‚ the error oi conceutrating attention on one thing in a banquet and
forgetting others equally important (47-50), the treatment οι different wiues
(51-57), and the way to keep a drinker in taste lor his wine (5842), the com-
position οι the ‘simple' and ‘double' sance (dy-69), the choiee ol apples and
grapes for dessert (γα-γι), the garnishing oi the table (73-75), size οι dishes‚
tricus oi slaves, importance oi cleanliness iu arrangemeuts (76-87).

The Satirc ends with Horaoe’s expressions οι admiration aud carnest entreaty
to be taken where such lore and secrets os happiness were to be learnt (88-95).

who was Catius, and what is his relation to the gastronomic lecture oi which
he is the mouthpiecel It cau hardly be a name which carried no associatione,
for the drama would lack point.

ι. The Scholiasts give us a complete answer and one which meets iairly the
conditions. They say (1) that Catius was an Epicurean who had written a
treatise ‘de Rerum Natura et de summo bono'; (a) that in this Satira llorace'
is playing with the Epicuream as in the last he played with the Stoies.

It is a striking confirmation oi this statement that (as they do not say) a Catius
is named in one οι Cicero's letters (ad Fam. 15. 16). He is rallying Cassius on
his Epicurean tenets, and quotes jestinglya use οι ιιε term ‘spectra' by ‘Catius
Insuber Epicureus qui nuper est mortuas? Ii this is the person meant the
dramatic framework oi this Satire will turn, as does that oi the first and oi the
third Satire in this book, on a character irorn Cicero's Epistles.

Some such play as the Scholiasta suggest suits well enough with Horace’s
attitude towards rival philosophica, with his principle οι placing his poems
(whether Satires, Epistles, or Odes) as companion or contrasted pictores, and
possibly with hints in the Satire itseli*. We need not make this relation between
Catius and the discourse οη cookery very close. Horace's primary purpose was
probably to laugh at people who made gastronomy into a science and prolessed
to know better than their neighbours how to cook a ehicken or arrange a dinner
table (cp. the play of Sat. ι. 8). It occurred to him to give a further point to
the Satire by its framing aud placing, much as he gives a point to the idyllic
