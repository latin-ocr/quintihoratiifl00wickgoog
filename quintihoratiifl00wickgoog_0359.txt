338 HORATII EPISTULARUM

r 39-155· Poetry began with us in the rough improviaations of Fescenniue verse,
so rongh that the law had to step in.

156-160. Then came Greek influente, running and retining, hut the old rusticity
did not go at once, if it has gone now.

161-164. It was late, after the Punic wars, when Roman writers first began to know,
and then to try to imitate, Greek tragedy and comcdy. ¹

165-167. They were only too well satisfied with themselves. Their tragedy was
good enough iu spirit, but too hasty.

168-176. Comedy was thought ensier, but the fxilure is on this account the more
palpable. Look at Plautus with his coarsely drawn characters and clip-ahod
style 'l'lrat came from writing for money.

177-181. Another great difficultyuf the dramatic poet is hia dependence on hia
audience.

182-207. And the audience amongst ua, or the most numerous and noisy partui it,
cares for the excitement of spectacles more then for real dmma.

²08-213. Do not think that 1 am underraluiug the dramatic art. It ia wonderful.

214-218. But give a share of your patronage to other puets also.

arg-m. 1 know it ia osten our own fault that you do not. We are devoid
of taet, we are impatient of criticism, we are too exacting in our de·
mande.

rap-m. Still it is wouh while to see what sort of poete are set to celebrate your
great deeds.

aya-²44. Alexander, though he was particular as to the painters aud sculptura
who took his likeuess, pald a miserable poetaster for singing of his ex·
ploits.

245-250. You bave been wiser in choosing Virgil and Varius, und you know what
the poet can do to immortalite greatness.

²50·²70· 1 would sing your deeds myself, if 1 could. But 1 am afraid of bringing
you aud myself tuo into contempt.

Horace, taking his peu at the biddiug of Angustus, in order to iink the Em·
peror's name with one of hia ‘Sermones‘ chuosea with great tact, as the subject
of bia Epistle, an apology for the poetry of the Augustan age, for poetry as he.
virgil, and Varium, understood it.

The first eighty-uine lines are occupied in directly attacking the school which
decried all contemporary poets in its admiration, real or professed, for the ancients.
This leuds him in v. 90 to institute a comparison between the history oi poetry
in Greece and Rome, which is to explain why Roman poetry is only now being
brought to perfectiori. Itis the same explanation as that which isgiven in the
Ars Portica: ‘Grais ingenium . . . dedit Musa.¹ Peuce was necessary in either
case for the development of literature, but when once that extcmnl condition
was satisfied, there followed a spontaneous burst of artistic life in a thousand
forma The nature was artistic, aud only circumstances restmined it. In Rome,
on the contrary, all the original tendeucies were prudential and utilitarian. When
poetry came, ae it had come now, it came hya sudden reaction, and to people not
prepared for it. Then follows, 118 f., a plnyful passage, with its serious eide, in
which he pleads even for this new development of nninstrncted verse writing.
'It is better than many things, better than the sordid money-getting to which
Romans were inclined. lt has its use. Poetry is worth something in education
and in religion, as you recognized, when you set me to write an ode for the secular
