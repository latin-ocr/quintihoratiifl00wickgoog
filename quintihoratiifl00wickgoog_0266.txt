EPISTLE Vll.

TO MAECENAS.

Verses 1—9. Irnnrrsn of a few days in the country, Maecenas, aud it bas proved
to mean all August. Butes you would excuse me ifl were ill, so you must
excuse me for shuuning what malres me ill.

10-13. Rome iu autumn is deudly3 aud if the winter is sold, I must go to the
sea-coast ; so you must not look for me till the spring.

¹4·19· Your generosity to me has not been that of the Calabrian host who presses
on his guest pears that are so pleutiful that what he refuses goes to the pigs.

20-24. True generosity chooses worthy objects, but gives what it values. Ihope
I sm not unworthy of your bouuty.

25-28. What faiis me is youthful heslth and vigour, und that you cannot restore
to rue.

²9-34· If eny one says ‘you have surrendered your liberty, and can only regain
itin the same way as the vixen who got into the corn-bin when she had au
empty stomach,’ 1 take him at his word.

35, 36. I quite mesu what I say, and really prefer liberty to wealth.

37-43. It is not that Ι am discoutented or ungrateful; but you would sce that
Ῑ could cheerfully return all you geve me, und answcr as Telemachus
answered when horses which he could never use were offered to him.

44, 45. What I want uow is not the grandeur of Rome but the leisure aud peace
of the country.

46-98. The story of Philippus and Volteius isa warniug to the givers and receivers
of patronage. The latter should be wise iu time and draw back us soon ss
they find that the offered improvement of their position is no improve-
ment. The measure which suits oue man will not suit mother.

The Epistle is a picture of patronagc nr it should be and as it shwld not be.
It is implied iu the idea of such a poem as well as asserted in words iu it, that
Maecenas' patronage has been of the former kind-such as was houourable both to
patron und to poet. The Epistle, therefore, tanges itself with Sat. 1. 5, 6, and
9, which describe aud defend Horace's relation to Maecenas
