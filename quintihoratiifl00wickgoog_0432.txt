HORATII ARS POETICA.

Carmine qui tragico vilem certavit ob hircum,
Mox etiam agrestes Satyros nudavit, et asper
Incolumi gravitate iocum tentavit, eo quod
lllecebris erat et grata novitate morandus
Spectator, functusque sacris et potus et exlex.
Verum ita risores, ita commendare dicaces
Conveniet Satyros, ita vertere seria ludo,

Ne quicunque deus, quicunque adhibebitur heros,
Regali conspectus in auro nuper et ostro,
Migret in obscuras humili sermone tabernas,
Aut, dum vitat humum, nubes et inania captet. ²30
