’ 3. The relation os thepoem to Horace’s other wnutzgs. It must be
remembered that it is not a composition sui generis, which might
. find its place in any part of the literary life of a versatile writer. It
isan Epistle amongst the Epistles. Its topics, the length and
fulness of their treatment, the approach however distant, to the
proportions and order of a treatise, mise the presumption that it
belongs to the Epistles of the later rather than the earlier period.
Is there any positive argument to overhear this presumptioni
Michaelis finds one in the passage (vv. 48-72l in which Horace
claims for the Augustan poets and especially, in word at least, for
‘Virgil and Varius’ and for himself, at least as much freedom in
enriching the language with new words as had been exercised by
Caecilius and Plautus. He thinks the tone too real, strenuous, and
militant, to suit a time when the battle must have been over, when
the Aeneid had been ten years 'before the world and Virgil and
Varius had become classica. Hecontrasts it especially in this respect
with the lines in the Ep. to Florus (ιι 5-121), where this function of
the poet is spoken of (and pmbably with a tacit reference to Virgil)

· as one that all would recognize and allow. The difficulty cannot be

ignored nor fully explained. It can hardly have been a vital ques·
tion to Piso. Horace is no doubt dwelling on the point because it
was on his own mind and because he felt strongly upon it. But
‘Virgil and Varius’ are to him representatives of the classical school
of Augustan poetry for which he is always ready to do battle. They
are mentioned together in the same way in the Ep. to Augustus
v. 247, though that was certainly written some years aster their death,
and that Epistle gives abundant proof that the publication of the
Aeneid had not silenced the controversy or the voice of detraction.
A more serious difficulty, however, lies in the way of the earlier
date in the close relation which exists between the topics and
language of the Ars Poetica and those of that Epistle. The text

of the two is the same: ‘failure in poetry is due toan imperfect ι

conception of the nature of poetry as an art! The following points
are among those common to the two Epistles: the comparison of
the temperament which the Greelrs and Romans severally brought
