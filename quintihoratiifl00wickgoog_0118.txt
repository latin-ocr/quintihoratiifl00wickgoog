my inferiority to Lucilius. I don’t dispute the garinnd with him!

50-71. llou say I speslr of the ‘turbid strom that often carried much rubbish'
well, do you find nothing to criticize ln Homeri Did not Lucilius in
Accius aud Enniusl Why may we not think that Lucilius was too hustyi ,

The verses enclosed in brackets are found iu some of the roth cent. MSS. (φ φλ -

ts), but they were absent from Cruquius’ Bland. MSS„ and were certainly unknown
to the Scholiasts, who not only do not comment on them, but evidently found
‘Nempe incomposito,’ etc. as the opening words of the Setire, ‘Respondet his
aquibus culpatus fuerat quod Lucilii versus damnasset in satira “ Eupolis atque
Cratinus,” et dicit se non po'e‘tum improbasse sed versus) etc. It is iu favour also
of the more abrupt commencement thst Persius, un imitator of Horace; begins
Sst. 3 with ‘ Nempe!
