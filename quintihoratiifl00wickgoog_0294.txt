Wn may suppose that Horace hus given us as much light on me circumstances
of the poem as was sufficient in his judgment for its proper appreciation. If we
would purh further, several points are uncertain:

(1) The person of the messenger. Horace callshim Vinius (or 'Vinnins’; the MSS.

.' of Horace are in favour of the latren ὼε MSS. of Tacitus and inscriptions in

favour of the former as the Roman gentile name) and speaks of ⁴ Asina¹ as his
father‘s ‘ cognomen! The Pseudo-Acron aud Comm. Cruq. call him ‘C. (⁶ Cauinins'
some MSS. givel Vinnius Fronto'; Porph. ‘Vinnius Asello.¹ The heading of the
Epistle in the MSS. is more often ‘ad Vinnium Asellarn' (or ‘Asellum') than
‘Asinam’ ,

Both ‘Asina ’ and ‘Asellus ’ were well-known ‘cognomina’; the former in the
family of the Scipiones (see the story in Macrob. Sat. 1. 6. 28), the latter in ibe
annia and the Claudia gens. The jest on the name was a time-honoured one, for
Cicero (de Or. a. 64. 258) quotes it as having been made by Scipio Africanus liin.
against Ti. Claudius Asellus. There is nothing else to connect the cognomen
either of Asina or Asellus with the gens Vinia, of which the first member who
became famous is the T. Vinius of Tac. Hist. 1 passim.
