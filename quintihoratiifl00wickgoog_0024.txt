There are cases again in which we obviously have allusions to
anecdotes or characters which were public property, not meant
maliciously‚ but the employment by way of ¹illustration oi what
was already in everyone’s mouth. Such are ior instance labeo the '
type oi a madman ⁴, Albucius and his poison, Scaeva and his long·
lived mother, Turius the severe judge⁶. It is possible again that
where stories or traits which reflect discredit are given the names .
may be the veils oi known persons more or less transparent to
’ Horace’s contemporaries or his immediate circle. ¹
But there are two sources oi his anecdotes andos his names, which,
though we cannot measure exame how much is due to each, are
certainly answerable for a good many, and which so iar as they go
show that his purpose was genuinely to illustrate and vivily his moral
descriptions, not to give pain or teach the world to sneer.

1. Itis certain that 'many oi his stories and instances belong
really to the last generationi His satirical sketch oi Tigellius'
character in Sat. 1. 2. and 3 (which in the latter satire he makes
typical oi his satiric style) relates to one who was already dead.

Fausta, ‘the daughter os Sulla,' takes at least one scandal os Sat. 1. a
some years back. Arbuscula the mime-actress, and theson of
Aesopus‚.oi whom stories are told in r. 10. 77 and a. 3. 239, are
persons known to us in Cicero’s letters. The reference to Alienus
in r. 3. 150, whoever be the person, is by the tense oi ‘ erat’ thrown
back to a date antecedent to the text. ' So is the story oi Staberius’
will iu a. 3. 84 i, with the further indication that the ‘epulum arbitrio
Arri' is to be illustrated irom an anecdote told by Cicero in Vatin.
