PREFACE TO VOLUME ΙΙ.

—w—

Ι nave to express to the Delegates of the Press
and to the kind purchasers ol the first volume of this
edition my regret for the long but uhavoidable delay -
which has intervened in the completion of the work.
That it is completed now Ι owe to the unstinted and

unselfish help of my friend Mr. A. Ο. Prickard, Fellow
of New College. I desired at one time that the

volume should appear in our joint names and had ’

obtained the sanction of the Delegates to this arrange-
ment; but we sound the difficulties os joint work
too great, in view of the impossibility ol our being
much together3 and therefore, although a first draft
oi the notes on the later Epistles was prepared by
Mr. Prickard, I have ultimately rewritten these, and
made myself responsible sor the whole. At the same
time I cannot overstate the help which 1 have received
from him in this part of the volume, and indeed in
suggestions and criticisms upon the whole ol it.

With respect to the text I have little to add to
what I wrote, I hope with proper modesty, in the
introduction to Vol. Ι. Keller's ‘Epilegomena,' pub
lished in 1879-188o‚ has added to the obligation
which he and his colleague have laid upon all students
