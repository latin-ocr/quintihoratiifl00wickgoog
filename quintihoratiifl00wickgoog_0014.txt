Β GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO THE
SATIRES.

§n Diurktbrr of the iuro Books.

Ir may be taken for certain that the division of the two Books oi
Satires is a real and chronological division, not merely, like that os
the first three books of the Odes‚ the division lor artistic purposes oi
acollection given to the world together. Such a real division is indi·
cated by the very definite epilogue with which the First Book is
concluded and the prologue with which the Second Book opens. No
doubt something of this effect is given by the placing of Od. 2. 20
and 3. r, and in a slighter way still by that ol od. 1. 37, 38 and
2. r ; but in the caseos the Odes there is no mistake when we come
to Od 3. 30 and compare it with r. 1, that we have in them the true
prologue and epilogue to the work as a whole. To make the parallel
effective, 'Book 11 of the Satires should have an epilogue which
would mark not only the close of a Book but the achievement os a
tull purpose. Sat 11 is ended in a manner suitable to the more
dramatic character os the Book, not by a conscious epilogue,
but by a sketch lighter in tone than the two which precede
it, audone which gathers up and puts in more dramatic form
some of the chief topics of the book and especially of its earlier
part Amongst Horace’s collections of poems it is analogous to the
conclusion oi the Epodes and of the IVth Book os the Odes‚ not to
that of Sat 1, Odes 1-111‚ or Epp. 1. He has his two manners,
evidently, of ending a Book: but this does not render it more prob
able that he should have published the two Books os Satires
together and ended the first with ‘1 puer, atque meo citus haec sub
scribe libello‚’ and the second with ‘velut illis Canidia afflasset ’
peior serpentibus Afris!

But in truth the two Books stand apert from one another widely,
both in general form and topics, and also in tone personal and
