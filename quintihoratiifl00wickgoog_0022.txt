No one interfered with his patent to the title. Persius, who, even
when in his Stoic lervour he departs furthest from Horace’s spirit,
copies his form most closely, gives no name to his own composition.
Juvenal, to whom there are no uncertainties, no lights and shades
in his confident and ruthless declamation, returned to the name of
Satires¹.

lt the Satires are imitations ol conversation, they have naturally
a personal element. Conversation starts from persons and incidents,

must be allowed that Horace's writing has this effect in a singular
degree after the lapse os nineteen centuries. Even il Nomentanus
and Opimius had no lise outside his verses, he gives them lise enough
sor his purpose. The interest ol going behind what he has toldus

had the greatest advantage over us, viz. the question whethera name
is bonowed or not from some earlier writer. An instance which
