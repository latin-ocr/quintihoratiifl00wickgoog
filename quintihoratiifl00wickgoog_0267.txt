248 nonani scissurarum

The story oi Philippus and Volteius gives a picture to be contrasted with that
ol Maecenas and Horace. It is patronage based ou no intellectual sympathy
or real benevolence, but on caprice and a selfish desire ior amusement. It has
the eiiect sor the time ol breaking down the sturdy independence and destroying
the contented simplicity oi Volteius. It puts him into two false positions-first
as guest at a table where he does not understand the proprieties, then iu a
country lise sor which he has no taste or aptitude.

The story is cleverly imitated, in its outvard aspect, by switt in his ‘ Address
to the Earl oi Orford‚' though a different turn is given to it; his own banishment
to the deanery ol St. Patrick's being the analogue to Volteius' settlement in a
Sabine farm.

QUINQUE dies tibi pollicitus me rure futurum,
Sextilem totum mendax desideror. Atqui,

Si me vivere vis sanum recteque valentem,
Quam mihi das aegro, dabis aegrotare timenti,
Maecenas, veniam, dum ficus prima calorque
Dissignatorem decorat lictoribus atris,

Dum pueris omnis pater et matercula pallet,
Officiosaque sedulitas et opella lorensis
Adducit febres et testamenta resignat.

Quodsi bruma nives Albanis illinet agris,

Ad mare descendet vated tuus et sibi parcet
Contractusque leget: te, dulcis amice, reviset
