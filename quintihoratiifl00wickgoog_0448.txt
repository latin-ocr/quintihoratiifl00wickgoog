HORATlI ARS POETICA. 429

Nullum ultra verbum aut operam insumebat inanem

Quin sine rivali teque et tua solus amares.

Vir bonus et prudens versus reprehendet inertes, 445
Culpabit duros, incomptis allinet atrum

Traverso calamo signum, ambitiosa recidet

Ornamenta‚ parurn claris lucem dare coget,

Fiet Aristarchus; non dicet: ‘Cur ego amicum 450
Offendam in nugis?' Hae nugae seria ducent

In mala derisum semel exceptumque sinistre.
