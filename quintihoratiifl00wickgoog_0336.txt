LIB. 1. EPIST. 18.

Qua ratione queas traducere leniter aevum;
Num te semper inops agitet vexetque cupido,
Num pavor et rerum mediocriter utilium spes3
Virtutem doctrina paret, naturane donet3

Quid minuat curas, quid te tibi reddat amicum;
Quid pure tranquillet, honos an dulce lucellum,
An secretum iter et fallentis semita vitae.

Me quotiens reficit gelidus Digentia rivus,
Quem Mandela bibit, rugosus frigore pagus,
Quid sentire putas? quid credis, amice, precari?
Sit mihi quod nunc est, etiam minus; et mihi vivam
