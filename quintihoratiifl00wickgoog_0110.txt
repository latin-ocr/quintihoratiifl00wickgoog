SATIRE IX.

THE WRONG WAY TO MAECENAS' FRIENDSHIP.

Tris sufferings oi Horace under thehands of a ‘bore’ are the amusing part oi
. the Satire, bnt ffley are only the dramatis setting ol the true subject. In Sat. 6 he
told the story oi his own admission to the intimacy oi Maecenas, how small a part
he had himself had in it, how natural and consistent with seli-respect had been
every stage in it. He compleres the matter by this coutrasted picture of the way
in which vulgar and pushing people vainly hoped to gain an entry. The person
described is a man oi letters (v. 7), but oi a type which Horace despised, fluent,
vain, and effeminate ιιι. 23-25). His obtuseness and want of tact are displayed
in his acts, and he is made to paint with his own lips and in perfect unconscious·
ness the meauness oi purpose and method which Horace had in view when he said
(Sat. 1. 6. 51) that Maecenas was careful ‘dignos assumere, prava ambitione
procul': ‘He will miss no opportunity, he will take no refusal, he will bribe the
servants, il Horace will help him he will go shares, and together they will oust
all rivals' He was painting by contrast the lise in Maecenas' house, aswell as the
avenues to it (v. 48). Horace must osten have had requests irom such people to
introduce them to the great patron ol literature, and this is his answer to them.
His own tact had taught him the lesson which he passes on to a younger generation
in Epp. 1. 18. 76 ‘Qualem commendes ctiam atque ctiam aspice! Ἴ

The occasion imagined for the scene is when Horace is taking his morning stroll
(‘ ad quartam iaceo: post hanc vagor' 1. 6. rar). He is walking, as it chauces,
on ibe Sacra Via towards the Forum. When ffiey reach (v. 18) the entrance to it,
close by the Temple ol Vesta their paths diverge, ior his interlocutor was bound
ior the Forum to appear in a case, and Horace, who had announced that he was
going to pay a visit on the other side ol the Tiber‚ would leave the Sacra Via at
that point, and turn round the side ol the Palatine towards the river.

Horace is probably dramatizing an imaginary situation, or at least improving
some slighter incident3 but attempts have been made to guess the particular
person intended. The only uoteworffiy suggestion is that Propertius is intended
(see on Sat. 1. 3. 30, Epp. a. a. 100). The dates make this next to impossible.
Ii the Satires were published in tac. 36 Propertius would, according to the most
probable chronology, be only 1⁶. Propertius was admitted to Maecenas' circle
probably about the year 30.
