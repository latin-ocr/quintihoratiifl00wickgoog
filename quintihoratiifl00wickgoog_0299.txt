280 HORATII EPISTULARUM

Ad strepitum salias terrae gravis: et tamen urges
Iampridem non tacta ligonibus arva bovemque
Disiunctum curas et strictis frondibus exples;
Addit opus pigro rivus, si decidit imber,

Multa mole docendus aprico parcere prato.

Nunc age, quid nostrum concentum dividat audi.
Quem tenues decuere togae nitidique capilli,
Quem scis immunem Cinarae placuisse rapaci,
Quem bibulum liquidi media de luce Falerni,
Cena brevis iuvat et prope rivum somnus in herba. 35
Nec lusisse pudet, sed non incidere ludum.

Non istic obliquo oculo mea commoda quisquam
Limat, non odio obscuro morsuque venenat3
