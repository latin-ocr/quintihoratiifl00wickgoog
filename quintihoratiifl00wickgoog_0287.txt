greater or less,' etc, as though ‘ ve' could be used in alternative interrogation,
bnt ‘are they either greater or lessl’ i. e. ‘are they just what the world says, or
either greater or ( ⁴⁴ ve '') lessl' (a) Keller with the same punctuation understands
a repeated ‘Quid’z ‘what oi Smyrna and Colophon? [what] ol towns greater
or less in reputel' ‘ sama ’ being iu this rendering an abl. not ol comparison bnt
ot the ‘part concerned.’ (3) Orelli and Dillr. remove the stop at ‘lama' eon-
neeting the words ‘maiora,' ete. with the following line ε ‘Be they greater or less
than their repnte, do all alilre pale before the Campus aud Tiber streaml' In
this interpretation also ‘ sama‘ may be taken lor ‘ iu repute.’ instead os ¹ than their
repnte? (4) Schiitz removes the question at ‘Colophon’ retains it at ‘iamai’
The words ‘maiora . . . lama' theu become the qualification grammatically ol
‘Smyrna et Colophon,' ansnvering to the more special epithets which have been
given to Chios and Lesbos, Samos and Sardis. ‘What ot Smyrna and Colophon,
greater places or (it may be) smaller than the world thinks theml' This is the
view, substautially, taken in the note.

EPISTLE Xll.

TO ICCIUS.

Tffls Epistle brings together the locius ol Od. 1. ²9 and the Pompeius
Grosphus ol Od. a. 16. The purposeis in the first instance personal-to intro-
duce Grosphus to Iccius, who is acting as ‘procurator' in charge ol Agrippa's
Sicilian estates, It is to be noticed that Grosphus seems when the Ode (sce
vv. 33-37) was written to have been a wealthy proprietor in Sicily. He is now
returning to the island, and is in a position, we lrnow not how, in which Iccius
may be able to help him.

The Epistle also implies that Iccius has complained (either in a letter to
Horace or othenvise) that he is mnuaging the estate ol another rather than an
independent property ot his own. The poet rallies him geutly ior this (vv. 1-16l,

turning his remonstrance into compliments on the simple lit'e which no increase ·

os wealth would affect (vv. 7-11). and the mainteuanee ol high philosophieal
interests in a post where there was so much to loster a greed oi gain (vv. ra-ao).
From this be passes lightly (v. ιι) to the introduction and commendation ol
Grosphus (vv. 22-24). The Epistle ends with some lines (vv. ²5⁴9), ol which
the prolessed purpose isto give the news from Rome, but which, il we suppose
such an Epistle to be written lor a larger circle ol readers, associate with it the
names, in n climax, ol Agrippa, Tiberius, Augustus, and flood the picture as with
the light oi a returning golden age.

The last lines should also incidentally iix the date oi the Epistle. With respect
to the difficulty caused by the reference to Agrippa's conquest ol the Cantabri
see general lntrod. to the Epistles, p. 208.
