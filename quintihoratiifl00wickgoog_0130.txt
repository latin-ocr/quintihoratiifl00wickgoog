C. Trebatius Testa was a ‘iurisconsultus' of repute, a friend and correspondeat
of Cicero, who introduced him 1ο Julius caesar (Cic ad Fam. 7. 5). The letters
(ad Fam. 7. 6-22) are addressed to him, and the Topica is dedicated to him (Top.
1.1). Cicero’s letters 10 him are familiar, and deal iu raillery, as lnad Fam. 210,
where he rallies him for shriukiug from crosslug the British 01100001, though he

which he sends lt 13 supposed that Horace has such tralts in view ln vv. 8, 9.
Trebatius is probably dead at the time, aud Horace's interest 10 him is a literary
