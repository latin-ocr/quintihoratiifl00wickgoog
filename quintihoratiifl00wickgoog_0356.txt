THE LlTERARY EPISTLES. 335

to literature ; the indication of the constitutional Roman vice of
avarice as tainting literary men and spoiling their worlt3 the

complaint of audiences as inevitably lowering the standard of those -

who wrote for them3 the vindication (in one case, as suits the place, .
playful, in the other more unmixedly serious) of the dignity and

use of poetry3 the disproportionate share given (however it be ’

explained) to the drama; the special attack on Plautus3 the use of
Choerilus as the type of a poetaster. The more closely the passages
in which these occur are compared, the more likely, Ι believe, it will
be thought that the treatment of the topics in the Ars Poetica is the
later, as it is the fuller. But if this judgment is distrusted we may
still ask which is the most probable, that Horace should have
gathered freely from earlier compositions materials for a letter
intended primarily to gulde ayoung literary friend, or that when
he is bending his energies to write a particularly happy and accept-
able Epistle to the Emperor he should take so many of its points
from one which he had written ten years before to some compara· ⁸
tively nameless young friends.

Ι do not know whether it is fanciful to see some confirmation of
the later date in the new attitude which seems to be assumed in the
poem towards the moral principles and language of which we heard
so much in earlier writings. Sapere aude is the text of Epp. 1. 2.
Sapere est abiectas utile nugis (ie. ‘flinging away poetry as nothing
but an idle amusement 'l is the conclusion of Epp. 2. 2. Scribendi
recte sapere cst et prr'rrcrpr'um et sons is the motto of the Ars
Poetica In accordance with this change of view the principles
which have been maintained in the moral sphere are now shown to
have their bearing in literary matters: the virtue of consistency, the
falsehood of extremes, the necessity of effort and thoroughness, the
danger of falling into one fault from dread of another, the duty of
give and take, of weighing merits against faults before you condemn,
the valuelessness of a bribed Judgment, the folly of the false shame
which prefers to acquiesce in mischiefs rather than confess arrd cure
thern. Moral phrases have gota new literary application: ‘rectum’
‘virtus' ‘vitium' ‘error,' ‘quod decet,' ‘vir bonus et pmdens! It
is as though Horace's two tastes and interests had run at last into
one stream. Philosophy is no longer the rival of poetry, but has
become her instructress. The study of the ‘Socraticae chartae’ has
ended in the Rhetoric and Poetic.
