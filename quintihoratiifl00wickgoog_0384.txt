LIB. ΙΙ. EPIST. 2· 363

in his sense means (‘legitimum,' ‘according to the laws of true art ’1 the toll and
fastidious seli-criticism that it involves, he seems to be describing, and ia growing
and sympathetic words. the methods aad achievements of his friend, whether
recently dead or still alive—the poet Virgil. Thea again au ironical passage.
‘The world sees in such a poet how easily aad smoothly his verses flow, and little
thinks of the agony which they have cost the composer. But after all isn't it better
to be able contentedly to write bad verses! But: aad here finally he becomes
serious, ‘my true reason is that my mind is full of life and its problema. ls not
yoursalsoi’

The Epistle will naturally be compared-

1. With Epp. 1. ι, which haudles the same theme. It will be noticed that
any arguments for a later date for this Epistle, based on its language about the
poet's advancing years (vv. 55 f.) are answered beforehand by the parallel ‘solve
senescentem' of Epp. 1. 1. 8. What hc says here is very greatly an expanding of
the ‘non eadem est aetas, uon mens' of that Epistle. The change lies (1) in the
fuller space given to the arguments against a return to his old pursuit ; which
means probably (as has been said) that the question was for some reason. external
or internal, becoming a more pressing one to him: (a) in the greater meilowness
and confidencc with which he sets forth the philosophy of life to which he has
attained. ·

a. With Epp. 1. 3. It is oue of two instances, besides those addressed to
Maecenas, of a second Epistle to the same persou; and it is interesting as illus·
trating the reality of the personal clement even in the more general Epistles, to
trace the identity of the line taken towards Florus in the two. It is in both, the
young man of letters. to whom Horace speaks naturally and frecly on literary
topics, assuming the mutual interest of each in the other’s pursuits, but to whom
he is disposed to hold up divine philosophy as a better medicine of the soul thau
either literature or the ambitions of practical life.
