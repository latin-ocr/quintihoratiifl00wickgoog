⁴ 152 HORATll SATIRARUM

Et furiosus erit3 quem cepit vitrea fama,

Hunc circumtonuit gaudens Bellona cruentis.

Hic simul accepit patrimoni mille talenta,

Edicit piscator uti, pomarius, auceps,

Unguentarius ac Tusci turba impia vici,

Cum scurris fartor, cum Velabro omne macellum,

Mane domum veniant. Quid tum? Venere frequentes. 230
