210 GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO

which Horace felt both in respect os form aud matter horn the
philosophical dialogues os Cicero. It cannot be doubted that his
Epistles in the same way are influenced by Cicero’s Letters.

The differences between the Epistles and Satires are analogous to
the differences between the later Satires and the earlier.

Life is passing on and has brought to him, is not strong health,
the means os taking care of himself, ease, interests, and content-
ment. He spends his autumn in the Sabine valley, his winter by the
sea, returns to Rome with the swallows, and stays there only as
long as he feels disposed. His acquaintance among the congenial
part os Roman society has grown. He has a recognised position
as a manos letters. There are still critics who in public decry his
Odes and Epodes‚ but they read and admire them in private, and
they pay him the flattery os soolish imitation. He has no real
disposition to quarrel with thern. We see him in one light which
is always an amiable one. His correspondents are greatly among
the younger generation of literary men. He is interested in their
work, he has their confidence, and can speak at once honestly and
kindly with no salse affectatiou either os superiority or of equality.

Is his views os lile are richer and more mature than in the Satires,
his expression ol them is more perfect. We feel the training os the
seven years given to lyric composition. There is more ease and
music in the verse—more touches of imagination in the language.
He has reached the perfection of his own style and the most
finished grace os which Latin writing is capable.

Order of tle Epistles.

lt has been already pointed out (vol. 1. p. 8) how exactly the
arrangement os the Epistles in this Book corresponds in one irn-
portant particular with that os the Odes os the first three Books-
the first Epistle and the last but one being addressed, as Ode 1. 1 and
a. 29, to Maecenas, the last place in each case being reserved for
the poet's own pride at the accomplishment os his task. We may
trace occasionally in the order of the rest os the Epistles some of
the same principles which seemed to dictate the order os the Odes
and, in a less marked degree, of the Satires. Ep. 2 seems to follow
Ep. r as an immediate putting into practice os the purposes an-
nounced in it. Epp.17,18 are put together as dealing with oue
subject in a way that might be less easily perceived if they were
apart, at the same time the two are put at some distance hom Ep. 6,
