HORATII SATIRARUM

SATIRE ΙΙΙ.

SATlRE 1s otti: THING, PERSONAL CENSORIOUSNESS
ANOTHER.

Horace begins with a satirical picture oi Tigellius as the type oi a character

made up ol contradictione and inconsisteucies (vv. 1-19).

He supposes himseli interrupted (v. 19) with the question ‘ Have γοα αο iaults

oi your own l'

Vv. 20-28. I pretend, he auswers, to uo infallibility. That is the vice oi the
censorious in private liic. They are blind to their own faule, keeu oi sight
to their neighbours.

29·37· Little ianlts oi temper or manner or dress overshadow sterling merita

38-40. Contrast the lover turning his mistress‘s deiects into &antica

40-54. Ii friendship cannot go as iar as that, it cau imitate a iether making the
best oi his boy's deformities.

5 5—66. But we even turn virtues into vices

66-69. This ceusoriousness recoils on ourselves-ior we have our own iaults too.

69-75. We need (1) mutual forbearance. ,

76-79. (a) some discrimination oi the relative gravity oi iaults ”

tio-95. We see this in other casea We should think a man mad who crucilied
a slave ior a peccadillo. isit not worse to break oli a friendship ὶκοαακ oi
some triiling accident or improprietyl What are we to do wheu it comesto
graver offences?

96-98. The Stoic will tell γοα that all offences are equal; but this doctrine
will not square with liic, neither with moral feeling norwith utility, the true
basis oi moral distinction.

98-112. Historieally the sense oi justice is posterior to the experieuce oi injustice

113-116. The Stoic is wrong ln assuming a naturai criterion oi right and wrong,
wrong iu his conclusion that one breach oi law is as bad as another.

116-124. We need a just apportionmeut oi punishment to olieuce. Not that 1
isar too great leniency. It is the rule oi Draco that we are promised when

. the Stoic isklng.

124-126. ‘When he is king} do 1 sayl Why, he is king, so he tells us, as he
is everything else that is good.

126-1hs3, Α ἓῑοίο is supposed to reply, ‘lion iorget Chrysippus' explanation oi
t epara oa'

133·14²· ‘Well,' Horace answers. ‘lt is a poor sovereignty. It does not
save you from humiliatious. No oue recognizes it except Crispinus. 1 shall
leave γοα your throne, eontented ior mysell to live on terms oi mutual ior·
bearmoe with my unphilosophioal friends?

The connection oi vv. 1-19 with the rest oi the poem is not made periectly
clear; but the comparisou in the following Satire, vr. 78-104, between the inno·
cent sullies oi Satire, hali playiul aud directed against types rather than per-

sons, with the license given to real maliguity in private conversation, seems to show
that this is the liuh here also, and the true subject oi the Satira.
