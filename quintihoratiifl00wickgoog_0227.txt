{lrf the other hand, in Epist. 20, where Horace is apparently in·
tending to date the Book as well as his own life, he says that he
completed his forty-fourth December (the month of his birth) in

the year when Lollius was consul. This was in rac. 21. lt is
a natural mode of dating if it means ‘last December '-a less
natural one if another birthday has already passed. We are driven
therefore to choose between supposing that Agrippa achieved his
victory over the Cantabri or some parts of it in rs. e. 20, in spite of
Dion Cassius’ words, or that Horace’s desire to link Lollius’ name
with the conclusion of his book has led him to date it by the year

’ before the one last expired.

Horace once uses the word ‘Epistula’ in Epp. 2. 2. 22, possibly,
but not certainly, in the sense of a poetical epistle. In Epp. 2. r.
²50 he seems to include the Epistles of the First Boolr with the
Satires under the common title of ‘Sermones ¹.' Otherwise we have
no direct evidence what title he intended thern to bear. The
MSS. all call them ‘Epistulae’ and the Scholiasts say that the title
was given to them by Horace himself.

They are ‘Epistulae’ in varying senses. Some have not only the
form, but a definite purpose at the moment and such as finds
natural expression in a letter-enquiries about absent friends, as in
Ep. 3; an invitation, as in Ep. 55 the introduction of a friend, as
in Ep. 93 desire for information about awatering-place, as in Ep. 15.
To these we may add, as short and purely personal in their tone,
Epp. 4, 8 and 12. It is hard again to drawa fixed line between
these and such Epistles as 7, 10 and 11, where, though a larger
and general subJect is in view, the person addressed and the oc-
casion are never wholly lost. But the epistolary introduction and
conclusion tend by degrees to become merely an excuse for the
moralizing which intervenes, till, as in Epp. rand 6, the only relic
left of the letter is the vocative case which begins it, just as ‘Qui
ht, Maecenasl’ or ‘Vel quia, Maecenas,’ begins a Satire. It is of
course possible to underrate the personal element which is really

¹ They arc probably also included is said that Augustus ‘post Sermones
in the title 'Sermones' in the Suetonian lectos’ complained that none was ad·
life of Horace tvol. i. p. xxix), where it dressed to him.
