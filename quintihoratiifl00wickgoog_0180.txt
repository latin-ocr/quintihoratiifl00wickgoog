LlB. 11. SAT. 4 161

praises of country life in Epod. s byputting them into the mouth of the ⁴ fenerator
Alfius' lle chooses for the purpose an Epicurean of the last generatiou, known
to him chiefly, perhaps only, as having been laughed at by Cicero.

a. Both Aer. and the Comm. Cruq.. though giving the theory just stated
at the beginning of the satire, and referring to it again ou v. 88, have a note
on v. 47, which, unless it is corrupt, must belong to a rival tradition as to
the person of Catius and the point of the Satire. In its fullest form it runs

‘irridet eum quod de opere pistorio in suo libro scribit de se ipso: Haec primus ¹

invenit et cognovit Catius Miltiades! Nothing else is known of such a worlr
or person. Orelli, who leans to this explanation, imagines him to have beeu
a freedmau of Cicero's Catius.

3. Α third view was suggested by Mauso, and is advoceted warmly hy Ptof.
Palmer. lt is that Catius is a pseudouym intended thinly to veil the name
of C. Matius, the correspondent of Cicero (see especially ad Fam. 11. ay aud 28),
and the friend of Julius Caesar and of Augustus. Columella tells us that he
wrote a boolr on the art of eooltery, divided into three parts, which were called
severally Coquus, Cetarius, Salgamarius. Pliny speaks oi his having given his
name to an apple (N. H. 15. 14).

ln any case the humour of the Satire probably consisted mainly ln the mixture
of truisms and paradoxes ou the subject, and in the introductiou of authority
ln a matter where each man should be allowed his own teste. Orelli well
compares Sat. a. s. 51 ‘si quis nnnc mergos suaves edixerit assos Parebit pravi
docilis Romana iuventus.’

Notice also that the topics follow the usual course ofa Roman supper ‘ab ovo
ad mala’ (Sat. 1. 3. 6).
