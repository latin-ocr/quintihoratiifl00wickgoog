SATIRE Vlll.

nu ursrnnr's surana-annau.

A suares} oia supper given to Maecenas by a man oi wealth without taste
or breeding. Horace puts the description oi it into the mouth oi Fundanius,
the comic poet, ol whom he speaks with admiration in Sat. 1. ro. 40: but it
represents, no doubt, many entertainmeuts at which hc had himsell suffered and
been amused.

Three men ol letters have been inrited as appropriate guests to meet Maecenas,
Fundanius himself, Viscus (see ou v. πο), and Varius. The rest ol the company
consists oi the chief guest with two ‘umbrae’ (vv. 21, aa) whom he has brought,
and two ‘scurrae,’ ‘Nomentanus,' aud ‘Porcius' who are habitual irequenters
ol the host's table.

The host is called Nasidienus Rufus (vv. r, 75, 84, and 58)-doubtlessa
fictitious name. A conjecture of Lambinus identihes the person so disgulsed
with Salvidienus Ruius, who had been advanced by Augustus ‘ex infima
fortuna’ (Suet. Aug. 66), and who was put to death by him ior conspiracy
against his interests in rac. 40. In that case the Satire would be written some
years aiter his death. Nasidienus was itselt' a Roman name and occursio Martial
7- 54·

What is satirized is the vulgarity oi the man. He has literary men to meet
Maecenas, but be cau talla os nothing but the dishes. He is full nithe gas·
