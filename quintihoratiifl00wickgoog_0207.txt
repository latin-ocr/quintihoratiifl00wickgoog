188 HORATII SATIRARUM

SATIRE Vll.

DAVUS, OR FREEDOM AND SLAVERY.

A nlnroeulr during the Saturnalia between Horace aud his slave Davus.

Verses 1-5. D. ίΙ1 I could only have my turn at fault finding!
H. ⁴ 11 that Davus ’1
D. ‘lieu Davus, not a bad bargain to 1111001111, 10101111111111111.’
H. ‘Well, use the licence oi the Saturnalia, and say your say!

6-10. Davus starts oti in the style iu which Horace represents a Stoic lecturer as
declaiming, with stoclr instances to illustrate his picture 01 lise.

‘hlankind is divided into those who are consistent in their vices, and those
who hover between vice and virtue.

‘Priscus was an instance 01 the last, Volanerius 01 the first, and his lite was
the less miserable 01 the two!

²1-45· Horace interrupte. ‘What a long preamble‚ what does it all neser to 'l

l). ‘To you!

ΙΙ. ‘ How, villain'l

l). ‘Yon pruise moderatim but don't practice it. You praise the country
when you ure in town —the town when you are in the country. 11 you are not
aelred out to dinner, it lsall “a dinner 01 herbs.'' 11 011 invitation comes rather
late you are in a 11111 and iury to be gone. The poor parasite who meant to
sup with you goes away disappointed, but he sees through you, aod is more
honest than you are. Nay, Ι, your slave, am more 01 a philosopher thau you.
Don’t frown at me; li ten to the lessons which 1 picked up 110111 the portet at
Crispinus' lecture-room.'

46—71. Davus then begins again with a coarse declamatory comparison, evidently
(110111 vv. 53, 54 ‘proiectis insignibus, armulo equestri. ..prodis ex iudice
Dama ’) not addressed personally to Horace, between the vices 01 slaves and
those 01 their masters, to the disadvantuge 01 the latter, as worse and leading
to 0 more hopeless slavery.

7294 He supposes Horace 10 protest: ‘non sum moechus'; but brushes the
excuse aside with the Stoic doctrine that abstinenee from vice from secondary
motives is no true abstineuce. (Cp. Epp. 1.16. 46 1) ‘Yon are a slave whom
no manumission can free. 1 am at most your deputy slave or your lellow
slave. No one ia free, but the wise man, who is master 01 himself. That is
not the position 01 one who is at the beck aud call 01 a mistress.

95-101. ‘So you share your slave’s other 1011111. He loiters 10 10011 at pictores
(after his degree), so do you: though they call you a man 01 taste 10111,
while they eall him a lazy iellow.

101-111. ‘lle likes a smolring cake3 your virtue is not prooi against 0 good
supper. Ι1 he gets a thrashing, you geta fit 01 indigestion. lt is as bad to
sell your estates to seed your gluttony, 01 1010 slave to exchange his master’s
“ strigil '' 101 a bunch 01 grapes. [Davus is getting away 110111 Horace agaim]
