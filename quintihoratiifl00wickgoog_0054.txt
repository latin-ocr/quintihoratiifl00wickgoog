’ um. 1. sar. 3. 35

The musiciau Tigellius of this Satine (vv. 3-19) und oi the last (vv. 1-4) is iden·
tihed with the Tigellius oi Cicero'a letters (ad Att. 13. 49. 50, and 51, ad Fam.
7. 24). He was the nephew (or grandson) oi Phamea (named in these letters
aud ad An. 9. 95 9. 13, and ud Fam. 9. 16), a rich ireedman from Sardinia.

’,ι Ee had quarrelled with Cicero &cause he thought him almi in a muse oi
’ Ἰῖῖοιιιεαέ which the great orator had undertakeu‚ but was prerented from pleading
by the lact that the ense of P. Sestius oame ou the same day. We guther l'rom
the letters that he was a iavonrite oi the dictator Caesar. Cicero speaks (to
Gallus ad Fam. 7. 14) with contempt oi his Sardinian origin, ‘hominem pestilenti·
orem patria sua' ‘Habes Sardosveuales: uliumalionequiorem.' He calls him
‘salacouem’ (antelmo), 'a swaggerer,’ and speaks οἱ him as ‘addictum Calvi
licinii Hipponacteo praeconio? Porph. (on this Sat. v. 1) has preserved n line

oi that lampoon, ‘Sardi Tigelli putidum caput veuit‘

The Scholiasta identiiy him with the 'Hermogenes Tigellius’ oi 1. 4. γι, ι.
ιο. 8ο, the ‘Hermogenes’ oi v. 1²9 oi this Satire aud of 1. 9. 25, 1. ιο. 1⁸, and the
‘Tigellius' ol Sat. 1. ιο. 90. It seems clear however that this was another und a
younger person. The Tigellius ol Sat. 1. a. 3 and 1. 3. 4 is already dead. The
Hermogenes Tigellius oi 1. 4. ⁷² und 1. ιο. 80 is still alive, although Sat. 1. 4
contuius interual evidence of having been composed later than Sat 1. n (cp. 1. 2.
27 and 1. 4 οι), and Sat. 1. ιο oi having been composed later than Sat. ι. 4
(see 1. 4. 11 and 1. 10.5o). We may add that whereas the elder Tigellius was
lnmpooued by Calvus, Hermogenes Tigellius iu Sat. 1. ιο. ¹⁹ is said to sing
Caluus'ssongs.
