19-28. When you getan sudience mind you tell them whst 1 did, what 1 loolred

Itis the epilogus to the Book-playiul iu tone, but recalling, though ln sn
altered form, the proud and confident anticipations os Od. 3. 30. It iswith cha-
racteristic irony thst he describes the widespresd fame which he soresees, us some·
thing to be dresded rather then sought. The lust ten lines show the plessure
which he really finds in the thought thst sll the world will be interested to know
eve'ry detail sbout him. At the sums time heis, no doubt, so lsr serious in his
profession that it is the applause ol the lew thet he most vslues. Cp. the tone os
Set. 1. 10. 81 toll.

His book, now finished and resdy ior publication, is eddressed iu terms borrowed
in pert from the image oi s levourite slave anxious to escape from the protec-
tion eud restraint oi his master's house into s naughty world, where he will be
msde much olet first sud wronged snd iorgotteu preseutly. The figure is lightly
hsudled, not pressed (ss by some commentators) into tssteless detail.

On the date given in the concluding lines sse introd. to Epistles, Book 1.
p. 208.

The device by which the author professes to address to his own book what he
wishes to ssy to the world by wsy oi pressoe or epilogue, is frequent iu the Romen
poete, ss Ovid,'l'rist.1.1; exP0nt.45; Mertisl 1. 4, s. 1, 3. ², 4, 5, 8. r, 10.
104, 11. r, η. 3. Such passages osten bcsr traces ol remembrsuoe ol this
Epistle.
