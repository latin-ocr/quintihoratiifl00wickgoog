THE LITERARY EPISTLES. 329

relations of the Epistle to Horace’s other writings. V. 111 seems to
refer definitely to such expressions as those in Epp. 1. 1. 10, 2. 2.
141-144, and to imply that his abstention frorn lyric composition,
which is treated both by himself ¹ and by his biographer² as having
lasted some time, had now come to an end. This would, without
going further, limit usto a date not earlier than rac. 17, when he
wrote the Cann. Sec. and very probably its companion Od. 4. 6.
There is further a coincidence which can hardly be accidental be
tween the topics of the Carm. Sec. and those which he claims in vv.
132-137 for the Muse of Choral poetry⁸. There are again notice-
able correspondences of topic and of expression between vv. 252-
256 and the political Odes of Book 4. In v. 2 5² t‘arces Montibus
impositas ') we seem to have an actual echo of the words ‘arces
Alpibus impositas' of Od. 4. 14. 4, which occur in the description of
Tiberius’ campaign in the Alps in rac. 15. The general resemblance
of the topics suggested in the verse ‘Terrarumque situs, et flumina
dicere‚' etc. to the geographical passages in Od. 4. 4, 5, 14, 15, and
the correspondence between the subjects of panegyric in vv. 2 54·2 56
and 'those in 0d.4.15.6-9, if they are sufficient to build upon,
seem to bring the Epistle down to 13, since the 5th and 15th Odes
are connected with Augustus’ return in that year frorn Gaul to Rome
after three years’ absence. Mommsen sees a reason in this last fact
for thinking (as his argument on v. 16 had indicated) that the Epistle
was composed in the last months of 13. He argues that if the Em-
peror had still been absent there would have been some expression
like the ‘abes iarn nimium diu’ of 0d. 4. 5. 2. The necessities of
the Epistolary fonn are satisfied if the Emperor were at Baiae or at
Rome while Horace was elsewhere. Vahlen would place it in 14,
while Augustus was still in Gaul. In any case it seems that it should
have been sent before Book 4 of the Odes was given to the world.
The disclaimer of power to celebrate Augustus' exploits in proper
poetry (vv. 2 57-2 59), though natural to Horace if it occurred within
the Odes as an apology for what he is giving (as in Od. 1. 6, 212),
01 in an Epistle sent before ὼε Odes becomes less suitable if the
Odes are already public.
