more appearance of those liberties taken with persons of position (not

merely the thieves, moneylenders, misem, and parasites of later
Satires) and of broad references to real scandals¹ which he professes
to defend in Sat. 1. 4 and a. 1, but with apologies which, if we look
at any Satire but this one, seem to outrun the needs of the case’.
There is above all the curious tradition of the Scholiasts that und‘er
the name of Maltinus (or Malchinus) he was satirizing inv. 2 5 the
personal habit of Maecenas. If this be true it is so completely un·.
like Horace's bearing towards his friends ¹in high position that it
must mean that the Satire was written before his acquaintance with ⁴
Maecenas commenced, and preserved with Maecenas' assent if not Ι
at his desire.

§5. Tr'tle and Nature of flu Satires.

Horace uses two words to designate his Satires.

1. The only title which he uses within the Satires themselves is
Satira. This he employs in Sat a. 1. r in the singular, to describe
the form of composition or its spirit, ‘Sunt quibus in satira videar nimis ¹
acer! He is there speaking of himself as the successor of Lucilius, and
the word has our modern sense of ‘ Satire,’ the censorious criticism of
life and manners of which Lucilius had set the type. In Sat. 2.6. 17
he employs the plural of the separate poems: ‘Quid prius illustrem
satiris?' and it may be noticed that there he has in view another
aspect of Satire, familiar also to Lucilius (as he points out in Sat.
ἲ 2. r. 30-36)‚ but descending to him from the oldern‘Satura' or
medley, of Satire namely as a vehicle for autobiographical details
and the expression of personal likes as well as dislikes.

2. But it is noticeable that in the Epistles, when he looks back at .
, the Satires and ranks them with his other kinds of composition
he drops entirely the term ‘Satirae.' His classification is ‘Iambi,'
‘Carmina' ‘Sermones’ In Epp. 1. 4. 1 the first place where he uses
this term-‘sermonum nostrorum candide iuden’-he is probably
speaking of the Satires only; and so too in Epp. a. 2. 60, where he
