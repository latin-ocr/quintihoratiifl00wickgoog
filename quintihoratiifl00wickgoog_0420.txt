HORATll ARS POETICA.

Humani voltus: si vis me flere, dolendum est ¹
Primum ipsi tibi: tunc tua me infortunia laedent,
Telephe vel Peleu; male si mandata loqueris
Aut dormitabo aut ridebo, Tristia maestum
Voltum verba decent, iratum plena minarum,

Maturusne senex an adhuc florente iuventa
Fervidus, et matrona potens an sedula nutrix,
Mercatorne vagus cultorne virentis agelli,

Colchus an Assyrius, Thebis nutritus an Argis.
Aut famam sequere aut sibi convenientia finge.
