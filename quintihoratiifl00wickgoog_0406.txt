Is he advising him (vv. 128 i.) to take an Homeric subiect, or justiiy·
ing him in doing so? Is he implying (vv. 2 34 s.) that Piso includes
in his purpose a Satyric drama? These doubts are not more than
those which remain in Epp. 1. 18, as to whether Lollius is actually
the dependent oi some great man or is only contemplating such
aposition. We do not exclude in either case the literary purpose.
Horace writes not without consciousness of a larger audience. His
Epistle has its close relation to Piso's circumstances; but in writing it,
as in publishing it, he is thinking also os the general circumstances of
Roman poetry, and adding another chapter to his apologia sor the
aims and methods oi the school which he admired and to which he
belonged.

Another interesting question, which has been often debated, is the
extent and nature of Horace's indebtedness to particular writers,
’ Greek or Latin, for the materials of his criticism. Porphyrion tells
us that Horace, in the Ars Poetica, ‘has put together precepts oi
Neoptolemus ol Parium, not all, but the most important’ ; and he
carries out this view into some detail in the earlier part ol the poem
by giving Greek names to succeeding ‘precepta’ as vv. 1-9 περὶ
ἀκολουθίας, v. 28 περὶ εὐταξίας, etc.

Α, Michaelis, who published in 1857 an exhaustive dissertation on
the subject ¹, has again in the later treatise'‚ from which I have
quoted before, well characterized this statement, il it is to be inter-
preted at all literally‚ as ‘impossible and contradictory both of the idea
of an Horatian Epistle and of the whole tendency ol Horace's poetry³.'
Porphyrion may have noticed some points oi resemblance between
Horace’s treatment of the subject and that oi Neoptolemus, and it is
