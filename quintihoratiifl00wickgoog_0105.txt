CANIDIA.

¹ 'lna first, probably, oi Horace's attaclrs ou Canidia See Epod. 5, and especially
the introductions to Epod. 17 and od. ι. 16, and compare Epod. 3. 83 Sat, a. 1. 48,
a. 8. 95.

The Scholiasta (on Epod 3. 8 and on v. ²⁴ ol this Satire) say that under the
name oi Canidia was satirized one Gratidia ‘unguentaria Neapolitana! With this
exception we have no external assistance in reading the riddle ol the poems them·
selvas. We are to imagine a woman whose fascination Horace has felt though he
rcsents it. and which he attributes with more orless oi irony to magia The ludicrous
catastrophe ol the Satlre as well as the monle heroic air which flavours the narrative
seem to lorbid us to take it quite serionsly ; cp. in this respect Od. 1. 16 introd.

The sceneos the Satire is the Campus Esquilinus, the plateau from which the

the vehicle oi a complimeut to one who is already Horace's patron. The speaker
¹throughout is Priapus, a rough wooden image ol the garden god (Virg. G. 4„ 110)
which has been erected in th'e new garden. The transformation oi the ground is
barely complete. There are still ‘magna sepulchra‚’ and honesto be found by
