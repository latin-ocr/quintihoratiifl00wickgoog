LIB. 11. SAT. a.

Incutiat tibi quid sanctarum inscitia legum:

Si mala condiderit in quern quis carmina, ius est
Iudiciumque! Esto, siquis mala3 sed bona si quis

Iudice condiderit laudatus Caesare? si quis

Opprobriis dignum latraverit, integer ipse? 85
‘Solventur risu tabulae, tu missus abibis!

SATIRE ll.

orsitus, OR PLAIN LlVlNG.

verses 1-16. ‘Lrsrsrss my friends, to a lecture on plain living '-—it is not Horace
speaking, but Ofellus-a plain man, but a philosopher in his way-‘ listcn,
but not in a smartly laid out dining-room nor when your bellies are full. Go
and hunt, or break a rough horse, or (if γοα are only frt for such effeminate
exercises) have a good game of ball or quoit‚ and then 1 defy you to despise
plain fare.

16-22. Hunger is the best sance. The rarest delicacies lose their flavour if appetite
is wanting.

22-30. lt is, 1 suppose, useless to protest against the preference ofa pescock to
a bamdoor fowl. It is more costly and appeals to the eye. Even that is
ridiculous, for you are not going to eat the smart feathers. But your fancies
about food go farther still.

31-39. You think yon know whether the pike is caught iu the river or iu the sea.
You like your mullet large (though you must divide it to eat it) aud your pike
small. Your only principle is to take what is rare and avoid what is natural.
That comes from not knowing what it is to be really hungry.

39-44. You say γοα like to gloat over the hig dishfull. One is inclined to call
the south wind to taint the glutton's dainties; but there is no need: boar and
turbot lose all their savour when the stomach is tired ; then you prefer
herbs.

4⁴·52· Princes and peasants share the taste for eggs and olives. The fact is
that it is greatly a matter of fashiou. The nastiest dish ean be made the
vogue.

53-69. There is a great distinction in my jndgment between plain living and mean
living, forthere are faulta ou both sides. You need not be like Avidieuns.
