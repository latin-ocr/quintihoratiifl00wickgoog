218 HORATll EPISTULARUM

Sunt verba et voces quibus hunc lenire dolorem
Possis et magnam morbi deponere partem.

Ter pure lecto poterunt recreare libello.

Invidus, iracundus, iners, vinosus, amator,

Nemo adeo serus cst ut non mitescere possit,

Esse mala, exiguum censum turpemque repulsam,
Quanto devites animi capitisque labore.
