246 HORATII EPISTULARUM

Porrigere: ‘Hic multum in Fabia valet, ille Velina;
Cui libet hic fasces dabit eripietque curule

Cui volet importunus ebur.' Frater, Pater, adde;
Ut cuique est aetas, ita quemque facetus adopta.
Si bene qui cenat bene vivit, lucet, eamus

Quo ducit gula, piscemur, venemur, ut olim
Gargilius, qui mane plagas, venabula, servos
Differtum transire forum populumque iubebat,
Unus ut e multis populo spectante referret
Emptum mulus aprum. Crudi tumidique lavemur,
Quid deceat, quid non, obliti, Caerite cera

Digni, remigium vitiosum Ithacensis Ulixei,

Cui potior patria fuit interdicta voluptas.
