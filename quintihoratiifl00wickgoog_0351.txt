330 GENERAL lNTRODUCTION TO

2. Epistula ad Horum.

This Epistle has only one link with the political history of the
time. Florus is apparently (v. ι) still, as in Epp. 1. 3, absent from
' Rome and in the suite of Tiberius. Tiberius was in the provinces

, οη several occasions to our knowledge ¹, possibly on some that we

do not know of, between the year 20 and Horace’s death. This fact
therefore by itself does not give us any lixed date.

We can bring the matter a little nearer by consideration from the
relation of the Epistle to Horace's literary life. It speaks, not inci-
dentally, hut as its text and startingpoint, of his resolution to write
no more lyric verse He has held out, as it seems, hopes to Florus
(or to some one behind Florus) that he may depart from that pur·
pose, but he is not prepared to do so ². With a mixture of irony, but
still with evident eamestness, he protests that he has finally aban-¹
doned poetry and taken to what was his first and true love, philo·
sophy. The difference in tone in this respect from the Epistle to
Augustus is strongly marked. In that he speaks of himself as be·
’ lying his professions and beginning again to write verses. Here he is
repeating those professions in their strongest form. At what time
“could he have so repeated them? Not, certainly, when the Em-
peror’s wish had overbome his resolution and he had actually begun
to compose the Fourth Book of the Odes.

Could he have done so any more at a later date when that Book
had been given to the world? We cannot say that it is impossible,
“ but it is surely improbable. It is not the simple statement of a fact
as ‘nil scribens ipse’ in a P. 306. He professes to be giving the
reasons why he has given up writing Odes, and the chief reason is
the same which he gave in Epp. 1. 1, in lines which must have been
in the memory of his readers. If the Epistle is a serious apology for
not doing what was expected of him, the ground of his ,apology has
been aheady cut from under his feet. He throws the reason of his
refusal into the form of an autohiographical sketch of the place which
poetry had occupied in his lis. How incomplete and futile this
would have been, if, written in his last years, it had taken no account
of the fact that, after urging the same excuses, with no pressing
motive such as he describes for writing, he had broken his long
silence with the Odes of Book 4! We may add that the edge
of the complitnent to Augustus and his stepsons, which those ,.
