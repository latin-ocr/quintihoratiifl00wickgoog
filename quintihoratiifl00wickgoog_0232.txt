EPISTLE l.

ΤΟ MAECENAS.

Tria Epiatle is written'for its place. 1t is the dedication to Maecenas of the
First Book of the Epistles, and it is an apology (1) for his change of style-from
the Odes to the Epistles; (a) for the subject-matter of his new compositions. He
has outgrown the power and taste for lyric poetry. His soul isset now on attain-
ing a philosophy of lif . He has not done so ς but short of that, he would make
the most of such eclectio and elementary fragments of truth as he has made his
own. Itis his own mind and life that he professes to be thinking of ; but itis
implied that his compositione will reffect his new tastes.

Verses 1-6. Yon have every claim on me, Maecenas, and I have always acknow·

33-40. There is no passion that does not admit of mitigation if the patient will
submit to treatment.

41-47· Humble and negative as this is, it is the first necessary step to virtue and
wisdom. If only men were as eager to escape wrong desires as they are to
escape povertyf ¹

' 49-31. On all analogy they should be ao; for the prize offered is greater. the

effort required less, for virtue is to gold as gold is to silver.

52-56. Unfortunately the opposite doctrine is preached by the business world of
Rome and learnt eagerly by all classes.

57—64. The arrangements of social rank go the same way. Your place depende
on your money. How much better our boys could teach ns with their
nursery jingle ‘ Rex eris si recte facies.’ That is sounder than the law of Otho.

68, 69. Which is the better adviser, one who says, ‘Make money without regard to

a man and face fortune ’l
