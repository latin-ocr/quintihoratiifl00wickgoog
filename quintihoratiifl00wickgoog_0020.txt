in Epp. a. r. ²50 ‘sermones . ..repentes per humum’ seems meant

The term had in the first place a selidepreciatory meaning, and is
explained by the words in Sat 1. 4. 39-48, where he declines the
name of ‘poemata’ for his writings, and designates them as ‘sermoni
propiora' comparing them in this respect to Comedy, which is, ‘nisi
