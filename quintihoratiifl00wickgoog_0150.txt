SATIRE 111.

DAMASIPPUS, OR Α ΜΑΙ) WORLD.

Tun Satlre is based on the Stoic paradox that every one hut the wise man is
mad (ὅτι πᾶς ἄφρων pairarat, see Cicero's 4th Parada), which Horace treats atter
his wont, laughing with others at it, but using it aa a weapon with which, without
departing from his habitual irony, he can atrike at practical sullies.

The bulk ol the Satire is put into the mouth oi Stertinium lecturer oi the day
(like Crispinus oi Book 1), whom in Epp. 1. 12. ao Horace, makes, but in a ban·
tering tone, the representative ol Stoic philosophy. He ia otherwise unknown to ua.
The Scholiasts say his works filled ano volumen.

Damasippus (like Trebatius in Sat a. 1) is a maraeter in Cicero'a Epistlea, in
which he appears as a elever gohetween in the purchase ol estates aud works of
art (Cic. ad Att. 12. ²9 and 33, ad Fam. 7. 233 cp. vv. 20-26 cithia Satine).
Horace represents him (whether with any historioal foundation or not, we annot
say) as having been ruined audon the point os suicide. Stertinius meets him on
the Pons Fabricius and sares him from this lolly by preaching to him the Stoic
doctrine that all men save the true philosopher are mad allke-he need not be
ashamed ; let his misiortunes he aa ridiculous and hia conduct aa iuohsh as possible,
he has all the world as companions in his lolly. This isset out at length iu a
discourse which, as is usual with Horace, loses attera time its vital connection
with the scene. The dramatic tone ia resumed atr. 296, aud Horace ends the
satire by good-humouredly turning the laugh against himself.

This Satira should be compared throughout with Sat. a. 7, which deals in a
similar way with another Paradox.

Verses 1-16. Damasippus rallies Horace ior his fastidiousneaa and laziuess in com·
