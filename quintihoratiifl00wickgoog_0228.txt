BOOK 1 OF¹ THE EPISTLES. 209

present in the composition of any particular Epistle. But Horace
meant us, we may be sure, to see this clement in the Epistle itselt,
not to depend upon tradition for it.

It must be added that the Epistolary form becomes in some cases
a matter oi play-as when he makes a professed letter to his bailill'
the vehicle sor the humorous expression of his own love of the
‚country and dislike of restlessness (Ep. 14); when he puts an
apology to Augustus into the iorm oi a letter sent after the mes·
senger who is supposed to be carrying to him a volume of poems
(Ep. 13) ; or when he addresses to his own Book of collected
Epistles the confidences and anticipations which he means sorbis
world-wide audiencetobe (Ep. κο).

In calling his Epistles ‘Sermones’ heis expressing the continuity
in substance, and even in form, which unites the most important of
them, those sor the sake of which the book was written, to the
Satires. Their subject is the same, that which always interested
him most deeply,—the art oslif . It runs into the same topics, the
iolly os avarice, the wisdom os enjoying instead oi wishing, the
charrn of country lise, os moderate tastes, oi contentment. He
fingers amusedly, as before, the paradoxes os philosophers, and puts
even 'more confidently his view that more is to be learnt from
common sense and from the poets than in the schools. The style
is the same-the free and unrhetorical style of the best conversation,
playiul and serious by tums, lighted up by wit, good humour,
touches of poetry. It still cuts an argument short with an anecdote ·
or a lable. Thero is the same tendency to use an individual name
where a class is meant, and in doing so to mix indiscriminately
names oi the day with literary or even mythological reminis-
cences ¹. The epistolary form is in truth as much a dramatic
adaptation as the form of dialogue adopted in Book 11 ol the
Satires. As Acron remarkS, it is conversation still, conversation
with the absent instead of conversation held or overheard, with the
present: ‘Epistulis enirn ad absentes loquimur, sermone curn prae·
sentibus ²! In speaking of the Satires we noticed the influence
