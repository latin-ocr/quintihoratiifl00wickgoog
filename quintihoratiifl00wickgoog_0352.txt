Odes convey, would have been turned by this fresh assertion that
poetry was a weakness to which his poverty, not his will, conde-
scended. The Epistle then may, with some confidenoe, be placed
in the two or three years between the publication of Epp. 1 and the
composition os the Carmen Seculare, ie. between nc. 20 and 17.

Some difficulty remains in fixing a moment during this period
when the condition of Tiberius' absence from Rome is satisfied.
Mommsen (l. c.) finds it in nc. 19 before his return iroru his pro
gress in the Ea'st, which it is assumed took place when Angustus re
turned in that year. There is, no doubt, ‘some awkwardness in
bringing it so near to the date os Epp. r. 3, which belongs to the
same expedition, and which seems hardly consistent with what
Horace says, at the beginning of the present Epistle, oi his having ·
warned Florus before starting that he was no correspondent. There
is hardly time to suppose Florus to have returned to Rome and
started again. At the same time Mommsen seems to show that
Vahlen's supposition that Tiberius was in Gallia Comata in nc. 18
is uniounded, and that he was not there till 16, which is too late sor
the other condition oi this Epistle. In this uncertainty we must
leave the question.

3. Epistula ad Pisones.

The general difficulty oi the Ars Poetica, though it has become
proverbial ¹, has been exaggerated, being due in some measure at
least to preconceived opinions with which the poem obstinately re-
fused to be squared: but there is one element of uncertainty about
iton which discussion does not seem to bring us nearer to an agree·
ment. Itis the only one of Horace’s poems‘in respect of which a
serious doubt can be said to existas to the periodos his lile to
which it is to be assigned; one school os critics placing it in the
periodos the First Book oi the Epistles‚ i.e. between ac. 24 and 20,
another making it the work oi his last years, i.e. between rac. 12
and 8¹.

In the early centuries the question does not seem to have been
raised. No stress can be laid on the place given to the poem in the
