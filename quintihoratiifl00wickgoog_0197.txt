couuruv' msc Ano rowu cnr.

Verres 1-5· Iu my Sabine farm 1 have got just whct I longed [οη and mure then
that, I heve nothing more ιο ask ior.

6-15. My prayers ere the scoeptsble prsyers oi honesty, subeuntes, sud content-
meni.

16-19. Here then is the first theme sor my satiric muse, my happy mountain home,
aud the contrast with the vexatione und dungers oi the city.

20-26. anus, god oi the morning as oi all beginnings, let us record ι dsy iu
Rome irum its beginning. First you summon me in hot haste, in any westher,
to give surety lor a friend.

²7-s1· When that dangerons business is over 1 have to light my way through the
streets ‘What are yon about,' eries eugrily one whom 1 heve jostled, ‘in such
a hurty ιο keep an engagement again with Maeceuesl'

32-3p Ay, there is the sweeteniug oi town tite to me, but 1 cannot even go ιο
Maecenus’ house in peace. As 1 get near it oue wayluys me ιο remind me
thet Roscius clsims my attendnnce in the Forum tomorrow. Another thet the
scribes went me todsy. Another desires Meecenss' signature und 1 must
get it ior him. 1t1 promise ιο do my best he thinks 1 um putting him oli.

40—49. Thut is the way with my iriendship sor Maecenas. All these (nearly) eight
years it hes been misunderstood, the object ol remark sud oi envy.

50-58. 1 am catechized about stete secreti, and thoughts wonderful man sor not
revenling what 1 do not know.

59-67. So a day is wasted in Rome. What wonder it 1 sigh sor the country, ior
my books, my siesta, my simple supper:

67-76. snrongst iriends and homebred slaves, no ceremouy, uo gossip, but talk
on things oi moment, the nature of happiness, the grounds ol friendship, the
end oi lise.

77-111. My neighbour, Cervius, hus alwcys one ol his simple sturies which just
hits the point. For instance, it any oue is rash enough to spenk admiringly
ol the wealtb os Arellius, he will tell the table ol the town muusc und the
country mouse.

The Sotire is of great importsnce in fixiug the chronology oi Horace's life sud
writings. li it cun be dated itscli it fixes (v. 40) the date οι his admission ιο
Mceccuus' intimacy, snd so gives u sterting-point ior dating most oi the Satires oi
