seems to combine several of these defects is to be found in their notes
on the ‘causa Petilli,’ a cause cllibn of the time, or oue still remem-
bered, to which Horace alludes in Sat. 1. 4. 94, and again in 1. ro.
26. In the first passage he gives him the fuller name of Petillius
capitolinus, and speaks of the charge brought against him as that of
theft, and of his having been acquitted. The Scholiasts write of this
as with perfect knowledge, and say that Petillius was a friend of
Augustus, who had charge of the Capitol, and was accused of having

stolen the crown of Jupiter, but wasacquitted by favour of Caesar. It “

j has been pointed out however, as conclusively discrediting this story,
' (1) that a coin has been found with a temple on the obverse and the
inscription Petillius Capitolinus, which seems to show that Capitolinus
was a cognomen of the gens Petillia, and traced by them to some
honourable origin; (a) that the crime of -robbing Capitoline Jove of
his crown was proverbial as early as Plautus: sec Trin. r. a. 46,
Menaechna 5. 5. 38.

It has been already suggested that iu looking for real names a dis-

· tinction is probably to be drawn between Horace’s earlier Satires

(represented chiefly by Sat 1. a) and the later ones. In the greater
part of them his purpose was general. He was assailing follies, not
gibbeting individuals ¹, and we have uo indications or traditione of his
having vented personal dislikes by making his enemies ‘slide into
, verse and hitch . . in a rhyme’ At the ‘same time he euforces his
lessous by anecdotos, 3ηά sums up classes in individual names. He

even justifies the method humorously by tracing it to the example of '

his good father, who taught him morals ina concrete shape, not by .

, describing the character he wasto aim at or avoid, but by pointing,

as they passed in the street, to one and another as models or warn- ¹
ings (Sat. r. 4. 1⁰5 1.). There are many cases in which we can
imagine no motive for reticence, and in which the particularity of
designatiou would lose all point if the particulars were not real.
