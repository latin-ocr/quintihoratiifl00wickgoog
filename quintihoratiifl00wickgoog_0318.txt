NOTE ΟΝ ΤΗΕ SITE OF HORACE'S ‘VILLA.’ 297

oi one wh0, as we leam, was worshipped at Reate and who, as Acron
tells us stom Varro, was according to one view identified with the
Roman ‘Victoria' of the other names which we have in Horace
‘Ustica cubans’ (Od. 1. 17. 11) possibly still survives in the name
[a Rustica, said to be given to some part os the valley; but peasants
are so willing to recognize names which travellers suggest that
such discoveries are to be received with caution. Two names are
given os hills or sorests, ‘Lucretilis' Od. 1. 17. 1, ‘Haedilia' ibid. 9.
The latter has left no discoverable trace. The former is possibly
vfound inan altered form in the Liber Pontificalis‚ in a record of
a donation by the Emperor Constantine to a church on the via
labicana, where an estate is described as ‘possessio in territorio
Sabinensi quae cognominatur “ ad duas Casas '' sub monte Lucretio!
The name ‘ad duas Casas' is supposed to survive in the chapel ol
the Madonna della Casa on the hill side beyond Rocca Giovane.
The Mons Lucretius or Lucretilis will be the high ground behind it,
but it still may be either some minor point immediately at its back
or the whole mass oi hills between the valley and the Campagna‚
oi which the highest point is called in some maps Genuam, in
others Monte Zappi. This point is 4165 English feet above the
sea, and is visible to a great distance. The nearer tops are from
600 to 800 feet lower. When the valley was identified, about the
middle oi the 18th century ¹, the site selected as that os Horace’s
villa was that marked A in the annexed plan. There are some
remains oi an ancient dwelling-house, ‘a seattered fragment or
two of columns of travertine ora small piece of mosaic‚' and it is
said that the floors os six chambers were uncovered‚ but covered
again with the earth, as nothing of value was sound2. All sub-
sequent visitors and topographers took this ior the site till the
question was reopened (1855) by M. Noel des Vergers and Cavaliere
Rosa, the Roman exploret, who examined the valley together and
put sorward the claims oi a rival site (that marked B) just behind
Rocca Giovane‚ where some terracing is noticed. Their arguments
sor this situation are (1) that it answers more exactly the description
oi ‘post sanum putre Vacunae! But any place higher up the valley
than the temple might fairly be so described, especially as the pur-
pose of the expression is pretty certainly not topographical, but

humorous, being equivalent to ‘in holiday land' (see note on Epp.

¹The arguments sor the valleyaud de Sanctis, 1761, and by the abbe
the special site are given in books Capmartindespaupy, 17⁶9·
printed at Rome by the abbe Domeuroo Mr. Denms letter.
