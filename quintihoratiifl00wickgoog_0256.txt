EPISTLE V.

TO TORQUATUS.

Sus introduction to Od. 4. 7.
An invitation to a modost entertainment at the poet’s house on the night before
Caesar’s birthday. The tone and topics are very like those oi the Odes

1t you do not mind a simple entertainment, Torquatus,1 shall expect yon at
sunset. Iwill get you what wine 1 can: it that is not to your liking, yon must
send better. All is ready andiubest triminyour honour. Ieavemouey-making
and ambition. To-monow isaholiday, so we can sit all night iswe like. The
only use ol fortuneistoenjoyit. Iam in the humour sor merriment Wineis
nature’s best gift. My business is to see that all is neat and clean, and that the
company is well chosen. I shall have Butra and Septimius and, 1 hope, Sabinus.
There is room sor you to bring some gnests, but remember the drawbacks of too
large a party. Your business is to say how many you wish them to be, and then
to slip away from your business and come.
