276 HORATII EPISTULARUM

implies that he had a ‘pater' and was therefore ‘ingenuan’ Others heve thought
of him as oue οἱ Horace's neighbonrs, employed by him to carry his parcel from
his country house to Rome. ls the Emperor however ιο be supposed to be in
Romei Ii so, it has been suggested that the Sosii (Epp. 1. πο. a) who would
have prepared the copy, would be the more natural agents in its delivery3 also
that the imagery οἱ a jouruey ‘per clivos, flumina, lamas,' even is it be iu pert
at least metaphorical, seems less appropriate to such a short and well-beaten rond
as that irom Tibur to Rome. Ii the Emperor was abroad, as we know him to

- (a) The nature oi the ‘earmina' oi v. 17. What was Horace sending or
protessing to sendi The usual answer has been, tlcſsrst three books ey‘the Odes;
and there is much probability ιο be alleged for it, in respect os the importance oi
the occasion supposed, ot' Horace's usual employment os the term ‘carmina ' when
applied to his own writings*, of the plural ‘libellis’ v. 4 (coutrast ‘ libello ' oi the
first book oi Satires, Sat. 1. ro. 92), ‘fasciculum librorum' v. 13, and generally oi
the date to which the Epistle ia then referred Il, however, any more particular
date is songht, difficulties arise. The Odes, we have every reason to believe, were
given to the world iu mc. ²3· Angustus did not leave Rome ior Sicily and the
Esst before the middle oi n. c. aa. Are we to imagine, then, that Horace's Odes
were unknown ιο him t'or some months aster their publicationi orare we to look ’
npon this as aformal presentatiou oi a book which the poet already knew ιο be
approved oii Most we tall back on the theory oi a mission from the Sabine villa
to Rome? or should we remember how fragmentary is our lmowledge ol the
Emperor's movements‚ whether in Italy or outside oi itt
