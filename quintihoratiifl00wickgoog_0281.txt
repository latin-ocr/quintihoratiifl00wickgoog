262 HORATlI EPISTULARUM

Et mala perrumpet surtim fastidia victrix.

Non qui Sidonio contendere callidus ostro
Nescit Aquinatem potantia vellera lucum
Certius accipiet damnum propiusque medullis,
Quam qui non poterit vero distinguere falsum.
Quem res plus nimio delectavere secundae,
Mutatae quatient. Si quid mirabere pones
Invitus. Fuge magna: licet sub paupere tecto
Reges et regnum vita praecurrere amicos.
Cervus equum pugna melior communibus herbis
Pellebat, donec minor in certamine longo
Imploravit opes hominis frenumque recepit;
Sed postquam victor violens discessit ab hoste
Non equitem dorso, non frenum depulit ore.
