Tttrs practice is touched in passing in Epp. 1. 1. 77. lt is described in Cicero,
Paradox 5. 2 ‘An eorum servitus dubia est, qui cupiditate peculii nullam con·
ditionem recusant durissimae servitutis? Hereditatis spes quid iniquitatis in aer·
viendonon suscipit? quern nutum locupletis orbi senis non observati Loquitur
ad voluntatem: quidquid denunciatum sit, iacit: assectatur, assidet, muneratur!
lhc ‘orbitas' which was the temptation to it belongs to that disineliuation to
marriage aad its responsibilities which was a marked seatme oi Roman lile. See
notes on Od. 4. 7. 19, C. S. 18-20.

The satirical description oi thc nrts oi a ‘captator’ ( ,57) is thrown into the
iorm ofa burlesque continuation oi the ‹linlogue between Ulysses and the shade ol
Tiresias iu Odyss. 11.

It starts with Tiresias’ prophecy iu v. 114 soll.

ὀψὲ κακῶς νεῖαι ὀλίαας tiro πάντας irulpovs,
νηὸς ἐτ’ ἀλλοτρίης· δήεις δ’ ir πήματα einp
ἄνδρας ὑπερφιάλους oi ror βίοτον κατέδουσι.

trieve my lost sonuues Why do you laugh l’

3-5. Tiresias—⁴ is it not enough ior a man os your renown that you shall get saie
homel’

5-8. Mysus-‘The good part ol your prophecy is no doubt true; but so is the
bad, ancl 1 arn to arrivc at home stripped oi all 1 have, and find my stores
plundered by the suitors. What is a man without substance. even is he be a
king or a heroi ’

9, ro. linarias* lt is a simple case, aud may be presented ior simply. What
you dread is “ pauperies '’; listen. and hear how to become “ dives’'

¹0·¹i· Make up to some rich old man. li a delicacy is given to you, send it ou
to him—the best produce oi your iarrn; he must come before the household
gods. Whatever his character aud antecedeuts, never reiuse to wallr with him
and give him the place oi honour!

18-22. Ulysscs. ‘The place oi honour to Dama l That is to belic all 1 ever was?
Tiresias. ‘ Very well, then γοα must be content to go without wealth.’
Ulysscs. ‘I submit ; 1 haue horuc worse than this-only tell me, prophet. how
to amass wealth.'

23-26. Tiresias. ‘Ihave told γοα already. Turn legacy·hunter; dou’t be easily
discouraged il one or another escapes γοα.
