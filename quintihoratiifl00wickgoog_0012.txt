PREFACE. vii

of Dtintzer (answick, 1849). Kiessling's edition

came into my hands too late to be of full use. But
l have felt again, as I said before, that the editor
to whom the student of Horace is most indebted is
Bentley; and l have felt more than before (though he
only speaks to us through his text and short preface
and a few papers in the Journal of Philology) how
strong and trustworthy is the judgment, whether in
purely textual questions or in the questions of inter·

pretation which cannot be severed from text, of the ·

most Bentleian of English scholars who have touched
Horace, the lamented H. A. J. Munro

May l make two requests of the younger readers
whose needs l have had specially in view-one, that
they will read, both before beginning a Satire or
Epistle, and also side by side with it, the analysis
which l have prefixed to it and without which the
commentary will be incomplete ; the other, that they
will not be deluded‚ by what has seemed the unhappy
necessity of employing inverted commas sor the
double purpose, into mistaking interpretative para-
phrase for translation? The latter l have attempted
rarely; the former is often a convenient and necessary
substitute for a long note.

Wrnuwmou Commu, Oct. 1890.

Nota-l must apologize here for a misunderstanding which has led to
some uncorrected variation in spelling. To harmonize with the rest of the
text ‘cum' should be read in Sat. 1. 1. 86, 104, ‘baca' in Sat. 2. 4 693
‘aspectu' ‘aspicere’ in Sat. 1. 8. 26, 2. 5. 5, 2. 6. 603 ‘temptatum’ in Sat. 1.
ι. 80; ‘obiciebat' in Sat. 1. 4. 1233 and ‘o’ should be substituted for ‘u'
in ‘avulsos' ‘ vultis‚' &c in Sat. 1. 1. 58, 1. 2. 38 and several other places.
