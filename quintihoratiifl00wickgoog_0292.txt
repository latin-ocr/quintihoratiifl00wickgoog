LIB. 1. EPIST. 13.

EPISTLE XIII.

TO VINIUS ASINA.

Trns professes to be a letter addressed to one Vinius Asina who is conveyiug
some poems of Ilorace to the Emperor: the letter is supposed ιο be seut after the
messenger to reiterata instructions already gIven as to the care and tact to be
observed in dischargirrg his commission.

It seems obvious that it is an ‘ Epistle' inform only: being analogous in this
respect ιο Epp. 1. ao, for it is intended primarily for Augustus, to whom it offersa
jesting apology for any untimeliness in thc poet's presentatIon of hIs poems. lt is
adramatic rendering of the cantion in approaching Caesar which he recognizes aa
necessary in Sat. a. r. 18-20, and of the apologetic tone with which he addresses
the Emperor directlyin Epp. a. 1. 1-4. Much of the point and of the imagery of
the Epistle lies in the play on the family name of the messeuger, a play in which
the Romans delighted, and which seems not to have been necessarily offensive to
those who bore the name.

For further questions as to personality of Vinius, the nature of the ‘ carmina' of
v. ιγ, and of the circumstances imagined, see the additional note at the end of the
Epistle.

The Epistle should be compared with the poem (5. 6) in thch Martial begs
Parthenius to introduce his book unbbtrusiuely to Domitian's notice.

1-5. ‘Let me repeat the orders I gave you on starting. You are to give Angustus
my poems at the right moment, not bore him with them.

6-9. Refuse the commission at once rather than discharge it so as ιο recall your
family name of AsIna.

10-15. An ass’s strength by all means in overcoming the difficulties of the errand;
but once arrived you bave still to watch your opportunity for presenting the
book, and for that you want grace and tact.

16-19. Don't tell any one your errand. Now away with you, and have a care of
stumbling.’
