LIB. 11. EPIST. 1. 339

late in time of Greek culture, which has been slowly driving out the old taint
of rudeness aud has not fully done its work yet ; the faultr, in spite of their vigour
and spirit, of the early writers of tragedy and comedy, in their aelf-sufficiency‚
haste, and eagemess to make money.

Tumiug from the writers of plays he goes on (v. 177 f.) to arraign the audienoes
as equally wanting in the artistic spirit. They care for shows, not for good plays
or acting. Lastly, after explaining in a few words that in what he says he is not
nudervaluing the dramatic art, be turns (v. 214 f.) to other kinds of poetry, and
asks Augustus' support for thern. ‘ 1 know,' he says, ‘there are many of us who
bore you, but there are differentes between us, and happily you are not like
Alexander, you know a Virgil from a Choerilus And you will reap your rewurd.
Good poetry is indeed “aere perenniua” l would do my part aa your poet, if l
could, but bad poetry is worse than none.¹

The points of the Epistle are—
r. That it is ridiculons to judge poetry by its age not its intrinsic merit.
a. That the conditione of the development of Roman literature had made
it oertain that perfectiori would come late.
3. That Augustus' taste is a true oue; that Virgil and Varius, (and it is
hinted, Horace), have taken the right way to be classica, and so immortal. iu a
sense that their predecessore had not.
