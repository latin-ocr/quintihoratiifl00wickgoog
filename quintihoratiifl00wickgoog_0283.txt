264 HORATIl EPISTULARUM

EPISTLE XI.

TO BULLATIUS·

Verses 1-10. You have been visiting all the famous and beautiful places ou the
coast of Asia. Well, what do you think of them? Do you think Rome
beats thern alli or have you a haukeriug for one of the towns of Attalus'
old kingdom? or have you an enthusiasm for even Lebedus aa on alternative
to further travelling on the sea?

11-20. But travelling is not the business of lif. Itis good for those who are
sick, in mind or body. Those who are not do not need it, and should be

content to praise the sights ol foreign lands but speud their lives at home.

21-30. Enjoy what you have. Our modern restlessuess does not diminish care.
What we need is a well-balanced mind.

The occasion is arisit of Bullatius to places ot' interest on the coast of Asia
Minor, places of which Horace speaks with the air of one who has himself seen
them (see on Sat. 1. y). Bullatius is apparently to be thought of as still in the
East (see on v. 21), perhaps as having written a letter, to which this is an answer,
with some traveller's raptores on the beautiful places hc isvisiting. The substance
of the Epistle is an indictment of foreign travel us a form of the restlessness of the
age. The feeling which finds definite expression herois to be traoed· in many

passages of the Odes. It is part of the motiwe of Od. 1. 3-Horaoe wishes Virgil
a happy voyage, but ‘non inridet, miratur magis:’ of Od. 1. y-he agrees with
Plancus that Rhodes aud Mytilene do not make up for banishment from Tibur,
even though he preaches for the occasion patience umder it: of Od. a. 6—‘Septi·
mius' friendship would stand the strain of any travel. but may it not be putto such
astrainl “Sit modus lasso maris et viarum.’' ltismore plainly putind. 216.
18 foll, which should be specially compared with this Epistle.

Nothing is known of Bullatius. It is possible that he visited the Eust in the
traiu of Tiberius: see introd. to Epp. 1. 3.
