282 HORATIl EPISTULARUM

EPISTLE XV.

To VALA.

Trtts is one oi the Epistles which cany on their iace more oi the occasion and
purpose oi a true letter. Horace writes to Vala as one well acquainted with the
coast in that part oi Italy to ask about Velia and Salernum as winter resorts; ex·
plaining by the way why heis not going as usual to Baiae: ‘It is not my fault,
but that oi Antonius Musa, who bas put me on the cold water treatment: yet, no
doubt‚l am looked upon at Baiae as a traitor and renegade.' The questions
which he asks (with this interpolated explanation iu vv. 2-13) last until v. 25.
The remainder oi the Epistle is occupied with an ironical apology sor the incon·
sistency between these particular enqoiries as to the luxuries to be had at the
southern watering·piaces arrd the tone oi coutented Stoicism with which his friends
at this time were familiar. ‘Yon see aiter all 1 am like Maeuius, a philosopher
whenI must be so, a bon-vivant when 1 can’ (vv. 26-46). This turn oi the
Epistle hasbeen prepared ior by the parenthesis ivn. 16-21), in which he explains
that he asks about the water rather than the wine os the country, not that be means
to drink water, but because, although at home at his sarm he can drink anything,
at the seaside he wants something better than ‘vin dn pays’

Missing the connection oi thought, some ol the best MSS. divide the Epistle, be
ginning a new one at v. 26 (see introd. to Ode r. 7).

of the Vala oi this Epistle, called Numonius Vala in the heading given in several
MSS, we know nothing certainly. The name of Q. Numonius Vala bas been
iound in an inscription* at Paestum—hali-way, that is, between Salernum and Velia.
We guther t'rorn the Epistle that he was well acquainted with both places, and from
v. 46, probably, that he had a bandsome country house in the neighbourhood.
One Numonius Vale mct an inglorious death in the German campaign oi mn. 9
under Vama, but there is ι othing to identisy the two.

We may note in the Epistle the recurrence to the topic oi his own inconsistency,
especially in respect oi his love of simplicityand pretensiohs to philosophy. He is
consciens that such charges are made against him, and he meets thern sometimes
with denial, sometimes with playiul and hall-ironical consessione. We must not
be mislcd by tliese, or suppose that he really attributes to himself the same motives
as to Maenius. His true answer is little more thau ‘there isa time ior¹ every·
thing.' ln the last Epistle he preached that lnconsistcncy was sometimes the truest
consistency.

some twenty-five miles south oi Paestum, a question always oi interest in Horace.
