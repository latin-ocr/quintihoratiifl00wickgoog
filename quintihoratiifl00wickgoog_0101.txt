SATIRE Vll.

RUPILIUS REX.

A Pnasonm anecdota irum Horace's experience in the short period that he was
attached to Brutns' fortunes. Brutus, who was ‘Praetor urbanus’ in the year 44,
had been promised by Caesar the province oi Macedonia, aud aiter a struggle with
C. Antonius, who had been actually nominated to it by the senate, took posses-
sion oi it at the beginning oi lac. 4³· Cassius had in a similar way taket posses·
sion oi the province ol Syria. Iu the course oi this year C. Trebonius, another oi
the conspirators, who, having been consul in 45, had received the proconsular pro·
vince oi Asia, was treacherously murdered by Dolabella. This brought both
Bmtus and Cassius into Asia. ’

The scene oi the story is laid nt Clazomenae on the bay oi Smyrna, where
Brutus is represented as holding a ‘conventus' aa though he were ‘proconsul'

Τὴε story all leads up to the play on the name oi ‘ Rex,’ with which it concludes,
and which was oi a lrind which gave especial pleasure to Romans; but it is told
with some humour, and the different types oi the two litigants are well
marked, the hali-Greek trader and money-lender, courtly, fluent, witty, and the
country-bred Roman oi Praeneste,‚with his thick skiu and heavyhauded sarcasmo.

There is no certain indication oi the date, but everything points to an early one.
'The jolre on Brutus's act (v. 34), is one most naturally made bciore his tragical
end, and is at any rate one which Horace would have avoided when he had
come to Rome and had realined that the world was passing to ‘Cacsar’s avenger.'
