DE ARTE POETICA LIBER.

verses 1-5. You expect a picture to represent something real: not incongruens
aud impossible combinations.

6-13. The same rule binds a poet. What he conceives (ie. whether as a whole
or in detaill must be possible aud whole.

r4-a 3. This rule is violated hythe ‘purple patch ' system. Your beauties must
be relevant. Remember always your purpose and its conditione

24·³1· Blunders in this matter proceed from the common failiug‚ the incapaeity
to avoid one mistalre without falling into its opposite. One wauts art even
to escape saulis.

32-37. It is the same in sculpture. It is easier to work up some details than ιο
conceive a whole. But it is ns in the human iace : acroolred noae spoils the
effect ot' good eyes and hair.

38-41. The key lies in choosinga subject within your powers Once do thet
and you will not iail either in finding plenty to say or in power to arrange it.

42-45. By arrangement 1 mean knowing when to say a thing, when to omit or
postpone it, the power to pick and choose.

46-72. That must be exercised in respect oi dr'clion. It is a very happy knaolr
to mnke an old word new by a slrilsul conjunction. You may also invent
words ii it be necessary3 but it must be in moderatiori, and yon will do well
to go ιο Greek as your well-spring. The old poets invented words, why may
not modern? Words, like other human things, have their day, and pass
and change.

73-88. The different types oi poetry have been marked out by the Greek masters,
aud stamped with their appropriate nutres, and we must keep to them.

89-118. So generally with respect to the style of diction. The comic and the
tragic arc distinct, though oi course to a certain extent each borrows the tone
oi the other. This is owing to the larger law that emotion is only stirred
by emotion, and the language must correspond to the emotion. Respect
must be had too to the characters who are speaking.

119-127. ln respect oi characters you may follow tradition or invent. In either
case you have your law. Traditional characters must keep their traditional
features. Newly invented ones must be consistent with their owu idea.

128-135. Real originality in dealing with common things is so difficult that you
are doing better to dramatize some oi the Homeric story than to start a new
plot. There is room ior originality still within these limite, in the eholce οἱ
your subject aud in the freedom oi your imitation.

136-152. imitate Homer in the modesty oi your beginning, iu avoiding lengthy
and prosaic introductione, ln consistency oi story.
