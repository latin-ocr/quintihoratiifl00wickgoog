. SATIRE Ι.

THE FOLLY 01² WlSlllNG lNSTEAD OF ENJOYING.

Tms iolly is seen in its extreme t'orm in the hourder oi money. His case, his
nnreasonableness and the vanity oi his excuses, sre set out at length, hut the Satire
begins and ends more generally. Men are always wishing lor what they have not,
and so they do not enjoy what they have, and when lise is over do not feel that
they have had their share.

Verses 1-12 state the difficulty generally. The world is a scene oi discontent-
restlessuess-every one wishing to be what he is not. ⁵

(ig-41). 'lhe absurdity oi this is shown by two considerations.

13-22. (a) That is you could imagine men's wishes granted, they would not melre
the erchange. The wish is not a real one.

²3·41· (b) That it'you take the great object ol wishing and motive oi action,
money, every one, whatever hia profession, will tell you that he seeks it sorau
end-give him un assured competence and he looks to retire. He is like the
ant storing t'or winter. ls hei The apt when winter comes uses its store and
ceases from work, but the seelcer after money never stopa while there is a man

“ left richer thau himself.

(41-107). Horace then proceeds to argue more fully with the man who accumulatus

bnt does not use. partly directly, partly imagining and replying to plens which ⁸

he may be supposed to urge ior himself.

41, 4²· What is the pleasure oi storing, however large aa amount oi precious metal,
in the earth?

43, 44· ‘li you once touch the heap lt melts away? But surely it is meant to be
touched.

45-50. The pleasnre is measured aot by the sire oi the store but hythe capacity oi
enjoyment. However full your barus are you can‘t eat more than 1 can.

51. ‘It is pleasant to leel that you are drawing from a large store’

52-60. It makes no dlfference ii the amount we draw is the same. Nay, it does
make a dill'e'rence in another way. Ι prefer the clear and quiet little spring to
the dangerous and turhid river.

61, ⁶2. ‘Where are we to stop? Α man is estimated by his possessions.'

63⁴7. It is useless arguing-the miser ia so wrapt in his seli-esteem. Il the people
hiss him he will applaud himself.

68-79. You are like Tantalus, thirsting amld water. Money has definite uses-
you get none oi its pleasures-all its paius.

iio—83. ‘At least money secures help in sickness’

⁸4⁵91· Yon are alleuating the love ready iormed ior you, and which yon might so
easily retain.
