MSS. (see above, p. 327). The Odes always stand before the Epodes3
the Epistles in many MSS. before the Satires. These inversions of
the chronological order are traced with great probability to the large
use of Horace's writings (a use which dates as early as Juvenal, see
Sat. 7. ²²7) for the purpose of school reaching. The Odes and the
Ars Poetica are, for different reasons, the compositions which would
be thought most serviceable. The only substantial contribution to
the question of date made by the Scholiasta is in Porphyrion’s state-
ment (of which there is no sign that he perceived the chronological
import) that the ‘Pisq pater' of the poem is ‘L. Piso custos, id est,
praefectus urbis, nam et ipse Piso poeta fuit et studiorum liberalium
antistes’ This is the man who was consul in rac. 15, and whose Ι

death Tacitus records in Ann. 6. ro. He died in luo. 31 at the ⁰..

age of 80. He was born therefore in the year ac. 49. This will
allow of his having had two sons growing up to manhood (‘ iuvenes ¹)

Horace. He bada son also named Gnaeus, who was consul in rac.

When the Ars Poetica was transferred by H. Stephanus and
lambinus to its present place at the end of Horace’s works it seems
to have been taken for granted that this was its true chronological

view has been maintained in this century by Kirchner, Ritter, ¹
Dillenburger and Orelli. Franke, on the other hand, leans to the
earlier date, and this is the one which has been in most favour with
recent critics. The arguments for it have been most fully stated by
A. Michaelis ¹ and more recently by Prof. Nettleship'. Porphyrion's
identification of Piso evidently does not settle the question, the

Scholiasts being frequently wrong in such cases (see above, p. 9).
We are thrown back on internal evidence. This is of three kinds.

The strongest case for the earlier date is the mention of Maecius
(v. 389) as the critic to whom, in addition to Horace and his own
father, the young Piso is to submit his future poem. If this is the
