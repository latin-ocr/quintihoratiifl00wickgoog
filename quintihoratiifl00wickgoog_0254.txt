EPISTLE lV.

TO ALBIUS TIBULLUS.

Anulus to whom I owe thanks ior your tair judgment os my Satires, 1 wonder
what you are doing at your country house-writing your excellent verses, or 111011-
ing in tbe forest, gaiaing bealth and meditating like a philosopher? You ure a
happy man with all the giits outward and inward. Mind yon keep to the true
Epicurean creed, as, is you will corneto ree me, you will find that 1 do. ·

Α comparison with Od. 1. 33, which is also addressed to the poet Tibullus,
suggests that the enumeratiou os bis advantages aud the exhortation to imitate
Horace's philosophy oi lite have a definite personui purpose.

The contemporary epitaph on Tibullus by Domitius Marsus seems to imply
that he died about the same time as Virgil (⁴ Te quoque Vergilio comitem non
aequa, Tibulle, Mors iuvenem campos misit iu Elysios '), ie. iuncto 01 18, ¹
a date which will allow this Epistle to iall within the same limit with the others
which cau be dated, i. e. before uc, 19.
