60 HORATII SATIRARUM

SATIRE V.

THE JOURNEY TO BRUNDISIUH.

Tira idea of the Satire was from Lucilius. ‘Lucilium hac satira aemulatus
Horatius iter sunm a Roma usque ad Brundisium describens quod et ille in tertio
libro fecit, primum a Roma Capuam usque et inde fretum siciliense: A few frag-
ments of the model exist: for one effect of its intluenee see note on p. 6.

Α chief purpose doubtlcss of the Satire is to give a picture of the pcet's relations
to Maecenas, the freedom aud absence of servility which chamcterize them; the
literary circle with which they were shared, the absence, even at a critical moment
in state affairs, of any political bearing in the intimacy.

Sc strongly is this last characteristic reflected in the poem that it lacks any
reference tc public events by which we might have fixcd the occasion aud date cf
the jonrney.

The only occasion on which wc know of an arrangement having been concluded
at Brundisium between Octavianus aud Antony was the so·called peace cf Brundi-
sium in lac. 40 (the occasion of Virgil's 4th Eclcgue), when Maecenas represented
Octavianus, Pollio Antcny, and Cocceius was added as a referee (κοινὸς ἀμφοῖν
Appian, Bell. civ. 5. 709). This is excludcd by the conditions of the case, as
Horace was certainly not admitted to Maecenas' circle before rac. 383 see Introd.

to Satires, pp. 3, 4. It is however alluded tc in v. ²9› where Maecenas and Cocceius ·

are called 'legati aversos soliti componere amicos' Kirchner (followed by
Franke, Orelli, and Ritter) maintained that the journey belongs tc the ‘treaty cf
Tarentum' in the spring of ae. 37. Antony carum on that occasion to Brundisium,
aa though that were the place appointed for meedug, but being ill-received by the
inhabitants went on to Tarentum, where eventuallyterms were arranged through .
the intervention of Octavia, who called in the help of Maecenas and Agrippa as
friends cf Octavianus (Plut. Ant. 35). There is no further evidence as to any
jonrney of negotiatcrs on behalf of Octavianus to Brundisium, and if they also went
on to Tarentum it is not explained why Horace stops the story where he does.
Schntz has lately suggested, with great probability, that the reference is to the pre·
vious missiou of Maecenas tc Antcny, then probably at Athens, in the autumn of
38 (Appian, B. C. 5. 728). Horace would then have accompanied him to the place
of embarcation. lt is natural that Maecenas should associate with himself for such
apurpose Capito, who was a persoual friend of Antony, and Cocceius, who had
been previously employed by both sides as an impartial adviser. Cocceius is
probably the M. Cocceius Nerva who was consul in u. c. 36, the great-grandfather of
the Emperor Nerva. L. Fonteius Capito was ‘consul suffectns' in ne. 30. We
frnd him immediately after the ‘treaty of Tarentum' in Antony's company, and
. ¹ employed by him to bring Cleopatra to Syria

1-6. Horace starts with Heliodorus and travels along ὼε Via Appia, ὼε first day to
Aricia, the second toAppii Forum, reaching it in the evening.

7:26. The joumey is continued through the night-bybcatalong the canal [which
had been part ofa scheme of Octavianus for draining the Pomptine marshes
(see A. P. 65)]. They land late in the moming‚ aud have three miles to climb
tc Anxur on its cliffs.

27-33. Herc the negotiatore join them, coming possibly by sca.
