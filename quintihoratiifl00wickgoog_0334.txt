LIB. 1. EPIST· 18.

Percontatorem fugito, nam garrulus idem est,

Nec retinent patulae commissa fideliter aures,

Et semel emissum volat irrevocabile verbum.

Non ancan tuum iecur ulceret ulla puerve

Intra marmoreum venerandi limen amici,

Ne dominus pueri pulchri caraeve puellae

Munere te parvo beet aut incommodus angat. 75
Qualem commendes etiam atque etiam aspice, ne mox
Incutiant aliena tibi peccata pudorem.

Fallimur et quondam non dignum tradimus: ergo

Quem sua culpa premet, deceptus omitte tueri,

Ut penitus notum, si temptent crimina, serves

Tuterisque tuo fidentem praesidio: qui

Dente Theonino cum circumroditur, ecquid

Ad te post paulo ventura pericula sentis?

Nam tua res agitur, paries cum proximus ardet,

Et neglecta solent incendia sumere vires. 85
