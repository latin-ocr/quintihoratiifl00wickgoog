rod-125. Perhaps you mean, and perhaps lt is true, that it is best contentedly
to write bad poetry. Writing good poetry is a very serious business. The
poet has to criticize himself severely. The ease you admira is won by efforts
which eost him tortnre.

136-140. And is it worth the painel To lose one’s illusions is not unmixed
gaiu. as the man at Argos found out.
