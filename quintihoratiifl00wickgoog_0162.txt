ln media iussit Libya. quia tardius irent

Propter onus segnes. Uter est insanior horum?
Nil agit exemplum, litem quod lite resolvit.

Si quis emat citharas, emptas comportet in unum,
Nec studio citharae nec Musae deditus ulli;

Si scalpra et formas non sutor, nautica vela
Aversus mercaturis; delirus et amens

Undique dicatur merito. Qui discrepat istis

Qui nummos aurumque recondit, nescius uti
Compositis, metuensque velut contingere sacrum?
Si quis ad ingentem frumenti semper acervum
Porrectus vigilet cum longo suste, neque illinc
Audeat esuriens dominus contingere granum,

Ac potius foliis parcus vescatur amaris3

Si positis intus Chii veterisque Falerni

Mille cadis—nihil est, tercentum milibus-acre
Potet acetum; age, si et stramentis incubet, unde·
