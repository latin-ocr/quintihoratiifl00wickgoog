LIB. 11. EPIST. 2.

Cum vitio fugere? Caret tibi pectus inani
Ambitione? Caret mortis formidine et ira?
Somnia, terrores magicos, miracula, sagas,
Nocturnos lemures portentaque Thessala rides?
Natales grate numeras? ignoscis amicis?
Lenior et melior fis accedente senecta?

Quid te exempta iuvat spinis de pluribus una?
Vivere si recte nescis, decede peritis.

Lusisti satis, edisti satis atque bibisti:

Tempus abire tibi est, ne potum largius aequo 215
Rideat et pulset lasciva decentius aetas.
