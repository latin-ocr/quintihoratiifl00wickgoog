242 HORATII EPISTULARUM

Tempora momentis sunt qui formidine nulla
Imbuti spectent: quid censes munera terrae,
Quid maris extremos Arabas ditantis et Indos,
Ludicra quid, plausus et amici dona Quiritis,
Quo spectanda modo, quo sensu credis et ore?
Qui timet his adversa iere miratur eodem

Quo cupiens pacto; pavor est utrobique molestus,
Improvisa simul species exterret utrumque.
Gaudeat an doleat, cupiat metuatne‚ quid ad rern,
Si quicquid vidit melius peiusve sua spe

Defixis oculis animoque et corpore torpet?
