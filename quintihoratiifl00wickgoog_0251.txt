232 HORATll EPISTULARUM

An pingues Asiae campi collesque morantur? 5
Quid studiosa cohors operum struit? Hoc quoque curo.
Quis sibi res gestas Augusti scribere sumit?

Bella quis ct paces longum diffundit in aevum?

Quid Titius, Romana brevi venturus in ora?

Pindarici fontis qui non expalluit haustus,

Fastidire lacus et rivos ausus apertos.

Ut valet? ut meminit nostri? Fidibusne Latinis
'Thebanos aptare modos studet auspice Musa,

An tragica desaevit et ampullatur in arte?
