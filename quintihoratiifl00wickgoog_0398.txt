LIB. II. EPIST. 2.

Si cupidum timidumque minus te, nempe tuberes,
Viveret in terris te si quis avarior uno.

Si proprium est quod quis libra mercatus et aere est,

Cum segetes occat tibi mox frumenta daturas,
Te dominum sentit. Das nummos, accipis uvam,
Pullos, ova, cadum temeti: nempe modo isto
Paulatim mercaris agrum, sortasse trecentis

Aut etiam supra nummorum milibus emptum.
Quid refert vivas numerato nuper an olim?
