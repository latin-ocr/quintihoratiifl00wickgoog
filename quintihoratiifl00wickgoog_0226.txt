GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO
BOOKI OF THE EPISTLES.

Date oftlre Book.

Tus Second Book of Satires and the Epodes were published
between the years 31 and 3ο ae. The three Books of the Odes
occupy the next seven years of Horace's life and were published,
as seems almost certain (see vol. 1. p. 2), in ac. 23· He may
have written some of the Epistles before that time, but all which

referred to and with it another which causes a little more difficulty: ⁵

‘Cantaber Agrippae, Claudi virtute Neronis
Amenius cecidit; ius imperiumque Phraates
Caesaris accepit genibus minor!
