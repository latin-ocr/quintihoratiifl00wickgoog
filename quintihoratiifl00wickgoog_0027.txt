14 GENERAL INTRODUCTION

traces of it iri the nomenclature of the odes—Phidyle, Lalage, Lyce,
Bibuli Consulis, etc, see App. 1. of vol. 1. But it is not done
wholesale nor on any apparent system. One of the most evident
instances, ‘Pantolabus scurra’ (ι. 8. rr, 2. 1. aa), is very probably,
like Nomentanus, a stock name of satire, not Horace‘s own. Of
others, the most certain are Opimius (a. 3. 142), Porcius (2.
8. 23), Novius the upstart (1. 6. 40). The Scholiasts assert that
Maltinus in r. a. 25 was coined from ‘malta' a word in Lucilius
for an effeminate person. Some colour is given by the verses which
follow to the connection-of Balbinus in r. 3. 40 with ‘balbutire'

The name Canidia in r. 8, besides being as the Scholiasts say a ⁸

substitution for Gratidia, may have been itself suggested by ‘canus'
and if so, Sagana by ‘saga’ though the quantity of the a is different.
Other instances have been found in Cupiennius, 1. a. 36, as from
‘cupere'; Avidienus, a. 2. 56, from ‘avidus’ (although here also
there is the difference of quantity, and the person described was
‘avarus’ rather than ‘avidus ’); Pantilius, 1. ro. 58, from πᾶν τίλλειν ;
Sectanus (a v. l for Scetanus in 1. 4. 112) from ‘sectari' 3 Voranus,
r. 8. 39, from ‘vorare’ Even when such doubtful instances are
included the whole number is a small percentage of Horace‘s names.
In several of the cases the other names used iu the same connection
have no such colour.

It is not perhaps irrelevant to notice that in the Satires as in
the Odes if names are kept occasionally to a given character as
Maenius and Nomentanus, some·on the other hand are used in a
subsequent Satire with no relation to their use in an earlier one.
So Albucius a. 1. 48 and 2. a. 67, Barrus 1. 6. 30 and 1. 7. 8, Cervius
2. 1. 47 and a. 6. ῃ, Naevius 1. 1. ror and a. a. 68, Novius'r. 3.
21, 1. 6. 40 and 121. We may add Scaeva in Sat a. r. 53 and‘Epp.

The number and nature of the poems to be arranged do not ⁸

admit of as much thought or variation in their arrangement as
appears in that of the Odes, but the principles at the bottom of the
arrangement are the same. (1) Itis not chronological Sat 1. r, as
we have seen, is subsequent to Sat. a, if it be not, as many think,

the last written ,in the Book; 1. y is perhaps the earliest of ali. , ’

Sat a. r again bas indications of the latest date to be found in the

Book to which it beldngs. (a) Each Book has its Satires written or ' .
