EPISTLE XVL

wwmm

Verses 1-16. You aslr about the produce of my farm, bnt seem hardly to under·
stand ita nature. lt is iu the heart of the hills, but for such a situation it has
all possible advantages-a sunny aspect, good climate, surprising richuess of
woodlaud fruit, and foliage, fresh water.

lt is to me a paradise of beauty aud safety even in September.

17-24 And now of yourself. l hope you too have found the secret of life.
We are all cougratulating you ou your good fortune—aud rightly3 provided
you are taking your mensure of your happiness not from our words, but
from your own feelings and from philosophy.

Troe happiness belongs only to the wise and good. Are you that?

²5-31· lf the world tells you so, do not believe it at once, any more than you
would if it told you that you were a second Augustus. '

3¹·40· No doubt all feel pleasure in being called good aod wisc.

But we must remember that those who give titles can take them away. Are
we to feel pain when they destroy our character? Such pleasure and such palu
are alilce proofs that we are not yet good aud wise.

40. For what, to go back, do you mean by a ‘good man 'l

41-43. The stoclr auswcr is ‘the man of respectability, who breaks uo law, whose
word is a bond, whose testimony is trusted!

44, 45. Nay, that is outside only. He may be a villain underneath.

46-49. Negatives do not constitute goodness, even iu a slave.

The truly good man is good from love of virtue.

545⁶· Truegoodnessimplies motiveaswell asact. The pretender to goodness
is often kept straight by fear of punishment.

57-62. But his true desire is not to be good but to seem good, iu order that he
may the better gratify his love of gain. ,

63-68. There is the true motive, and that makes the man who fcels it a slave.

69—72. Youmay make a useful shepherd of him, or ploughman, or trader, but not
a philosopher.

73-79. The truly wisc and good man is like Dionysus in the play. He fearsuo
one, wauts nothing, cau never lose his liberty, for· he has iu his own hands
the key of liberty.

lt is characteristic of Horace's irony that an Epistle iu which, more than iu most.
he assumes the tone of a stoic and mounts the professor's pnlpit, follows oue in
which he has described himself asa second Maeuius.

Who Quintius was, and to what extent he was meant to taire home the lecture,
we cannot tell. It may be the ‘Quintius Hirpinus,' to whom Horace addresses

counscls iu a very different vein in Od.2.11. lt is to be said however that the q

total ignoraucc which is presumed iu him of the poct's country house does not
point to a friend of long standing, aud that the tone of v. 17 foll ‚ if it does not
require, certainly suits well with, a friend young iu years towards whom congratu-
latione on some early success may not unbecomingly be followed up, by an elder,
with some good advice. We need not imitate some editors iu drawing outiu
