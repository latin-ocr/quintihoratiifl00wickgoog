- 288 HORATII EPISTULARUM

detail defects of Quintius’ character to suit the turns of the poet's lecture. Its
personal bearing is probably satisfied with ‘we are all calling yon happy, only
remember what the Stoics tell us happiness really means.’ We have seen in Epp.
1. t that Horace passes from a personal address to professoria] argument with an
imagined interlocutor without indicating the point oftransition (see note on vv. 41-
43 of this Epistle). lt is to be noticed that in the present Epistle he teuches in
succession on many canent Stoic doctrines, and with sympathy, not putting in frout,
as is usual with him, their paradoxical form. See notes on vv. 53, 55, (15 79.
The connection between the description of the Sabine farm and the discussion
on standards of happiness aad goodness which follows is not strongly marked.
We are meant probably to feel something of the easy inconsequence of u letter,
the early part finding its immediate explanation in some questions that Quintius
rnay be supposed to hare usked. The polnt of actual connection is made in v. 17
by‘ Tu recte vivis i' which implles that the sum ol the picture given in the preced-
ing lines has been ‘ego reete vivo! 'l'he retirement and simple pleasures in which
he paints himself as finding health and contentment are a fitting introduction to
Ι the remaiader of the letter iu which he is to argue that happiness cannot be
separated from goodness, and that they both are to be sought within us, not
without us.
