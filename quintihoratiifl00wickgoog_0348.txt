GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO THE
LlTERARY EPISTLES.

Tanna remain three Epistles (ad Augustum, ad Florum, ad
Pisones) which are oiten classed together as the three Epistles oi
the Second Book; an arrangement which derives aprima socie ap·
propriateness frorn their general likeness in topics and scale The:
title, however, as applied to the three has no ancient authority..·¹
The MSS. and Scholia agree in placing the first two together in y
their present order and calling thern the Second Book. The third J
Epistle' rs referred to by Quintilian twice, once as Horace’s ‘Ars ,ί
Poetica ¹,' once as the ‘'liber de arte poetica ξ’ and the former title is
given to it by Terentius Scaurus (Hadrian's reign) as quoted by
Charisius. Charisius himself cites a passage from it as from ‘the
Epistles.' In the MSS. and Scholia it is awais and stray placed if
generally aster the Fourth Boolr oi the Odes, less frequently aiter the
Carmen Seculare, once aster the Epodes.

Its present position is due to the editors of the middle of the
sixteenth century. Cruquius (1578) rs the first who calls rt the third
Epistle oi Boolr 2.

It will be convenient, however, without committing ourselves be
sorehand to any theory os their relation, to put together what has to
be said on the difficult question of the date and circumstances oi the
three Epistles.

The tirst two give perhaps some indication os having been placed
together by Horace as companion poems and in their present order,
in the fact that while one is addressed to Augustus, the other, al·
though it is addressed to Florus, carries in its first line a compliment
to T iberius. This reminds us of the careful distribution oi honour
between the Emperor and his stepsons in Boolr 4 of the Odes; .
and the argument is strengthened if, as seems probable, the Epistle
