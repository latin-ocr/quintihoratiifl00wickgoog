An qui Fortunae te responsare superbae

Liberum et erectum praesens hortatur et aptat?

Quodsi me populus Romanus sorte roget, cur

Non ut porticibus sic iudiciis fruar isdem,

Nec sequar aut fugiam quae diligit ipse vel odit,

Respondit referam: ‘Quia me vestigia terrent,

Omnia te adversum spectantia, nulla retrorsum! 75
Belua multorum es capitum. Nam quid sequar aut quern?
Pars hominum gestit conducere publica, sunt qui

Frustis et pomis viduas venentur avaras,

Excipiantque senes quos in vivaria mittant3
