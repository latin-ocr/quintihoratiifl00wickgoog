The Epistle is addressed to Julius Florus, to whom Horaoe addresses also the
second Epistle oi Book 11. See intsod. to that Epistle.

Florus ia probably identified with the Florus who is named hythe elder Seneca
(Controv. 4. ²5) as a pupil in oratory oi M. Porcius Latro, a famous ‘rhetor’ oi
Augustus' time and hy Quintilian ro. 3. 14 as ‘ in eloquentia Galliarum, quoniam
ibi demum eam exercuit, princeps ’ (cp. w. 23 os this Epistle). The Scholiasta
say ‘Hic Florus init Satirarum scriptor, muns sunt electae ex Ennio Lucilio
Varrone cet.' This has been explained to mean that he published selectione (Pliny
uses the word ‘electa’ iu this sense Epp. 8. ar) irum these older poeta, perhaps
moderuized (see introd. to Sat. 1. ro).

He, with other young men oi literary testes, is in the suite oi the Emperor'e
elder stepson Tiberius, who has been sent on a mission by Augustus to tbe East, in
the year u. c, ro, to place Tigranes on the throne of Armenia.
