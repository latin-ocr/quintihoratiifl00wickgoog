these is Ritter. The latter by those who think it to be addressed to a boy. (3) As
a cognomen. This is uo new theory, having been held by Scaliger, but ithae
gained general heliel since Meineke's advocacy oi it. There is uo trustworthy
evidence oi the cognomen borne by M. Lollius, the consul oi n. e. 21. Under the
Republic the only cognomen iouud in the gens Lollia is Palicanus A grand-
daughter oi his is called ‘ Lollia Paullina,’ and this has been supposed to indicate
that the cognomen was Paullinus. But the whole question oi cognomina st this
period is very obscure. A ‘Lollius Maximus' is iound in an inscription, bnt oi
a much later date. Keller compares Ovid’s address (ex Pont. 2. 8. a and 3. 5. 6)
‘Maxime Cotta' to the son oi Messalla, the orator, who had been adopted into the
Aurelia gens, and bore apparently both the cognomen which belonged to it, and

{hat oi Maximus, an old cognomen in the Valeria gens, to which by birth he be-
onged.
