12 GENERAL INTRODUCTION

2. Some anecdotes and allusions are confessedly due to olderl
poets, and it is certain that the list might be extended if we
possessed Lucilius and the latin dramatists in anything more than
fragments. In Sat. a. a. 47 Horace refers to Gallonius as having
introduced the ‘acipenser' to Roman tables and speaks of the evil as
having happened ‘haud ita pridem! But this is from Lucilius,
a fragment to the effect being quoted by Cic. de Fin. 2. 8. ²4- Three
names which are found in Lucilius throw some light on Horace’s
methods of employing the names he found in his predecessore.
(1)Pacrllerbnus¹. In Lucilius (4. 17) he is the ‘best gladiator since the ’
beginning of the world! In Horace Sat 2. 7. 98 his name is given
casually as one of the three gladiatore, the rough valldrawing of
whose performance fascinates Davus. If Horace uses a literary name
here instead of a contemporary one, where may he not be doing so'?
(2) Maenius. We know of Lucilius' use of the name from Porph. on
Hor. Sat. r. 3. 21, who quotes as from the older poet, ‘Maenius
columnam cum peteret,' and interprets it hythe story that Maenius,
when his home was sold over his head, reserved a column of it,
thence called ‘Maenii columna’ from whence he might see tho
gladiators. This is evidently a foolish invention to connect Maenius
with the column, due to some one who did not know that the
‘columna Maenia' was erected in honour of Maenius, the colleague
of Camillus, in rac. 338. We may suppose rather that in Lucilius
there was a play on Maenius(i.e. some spendthrift) ‘making for his ’
own column’ ie. subjecting himself to the jurisdiction of the ‘ trium-
viri capitales,’ vho sat by the columna Maenia 3 cp. the play in Cic.
pro Sest. 8. 18. In any case ‘Maenius’ is to Horace a name that
occurs when hewants one for a good-for·nothing fellow, the ‘pot that
blackens the kettle’ in Sat. r. 3. 21, the glutton and spendthrift in
Epp. 1. 15. 26f, possibly also the associate of Nomentanus in Sat.
r. r. 101. (3) Nomentanus is a name which occurs in Horace in four
different contexts. In the place just referred to he is with Naevius
(or Maenius) the type of a spendthrift. In r. 8. 11 he stands with
‘Pantolabus scurra’ as a representative of those who ruin themselves
and come to a pauper's burial. The line is repeated in 2. ι. 22 as a
specimen of Horace’s personal satire. In a. 3. 175 and 224 he is
